This is pretty simple.  Only an immortal (level 101 and up) may identify
themselves as such.  If you do this and are not what you say you are, the
punishment will be severe and final, and will most likely include deletion
of any characters involved.

An important note: DO NOT give your password to ANYONE who asks for it.
If someone who calls themselves a god asks for it, even if they are a god,
don't give it out.

If you have done all that you know of to verify they are actually a god,
and they still say they need your password even after you declined to give
it, tell them the last line in help impersonate says not to give it out,
and you were told to tell them that.  Do not give out your password.

TARGET
TARGETTING
NONE
NONE
NONE
KILL
L: 1
E:
There are two situations when you might need to target a certain
mob or player out of others in a room.  For instance, if you are
in a room with three mobs whose keyword is 'corpse', and you want
to target the second 'corpse', you will type 'kill 2.corpse'.  The
first corpse in that room will be 1.corpse, the middle 2.corpse,
and the last will be 3.corpse.

The second instance where this may be necessary is if you are in a
room that has a mob who shares a keyword with a player name.  For
instance, suppose you are in Stonewich and a player named 'Enforce'
is in the room with you and the Enforcer mob.  To target the player
'Enforce', you will type kill 0.enforce.  This will ensure that you
hit the player instead of the mob.

Note:     When targeting a player, you may abbreviate the player's
          name.  For example, 'kill 0.enfor' will target the player
          named 'Enforce'.  However, when targeting a specific mob,
          you must type out the full keyword, e.g. you must type
          'kill 2.corpse' and not 'kill 2.cor'.

PKILL, PINGPONG
L: 1
E:
Since time immemorial, player vs. player combat has been a large
part of life on Dark Castle.  While some may not enjoy it, there
are those who have strove to become the best of the best in the
art of player-killing.  It is in the spirit of pure PK that we
give to you the "Dark Castle House Rules of Player-Killing".

The object of the following set of rules is to provide a sense of
sportsmanship between those denizens of the DC realms who enjoy
the art and sport of player vs. player combat.  It will provide
a groundwork of basic rules which, those who wish to participate,
will follow in all of their player-killing.

On to the Dark Castle House Rules of Player-Killing!

Rule 1:  One must never recall from a pfight.  While
         recalling is prohibited, fleeing is not.  As many know, there
         may be multiple reasons why one would do so- to set an ambush,
         to make another backstab attempt, to heal.  Even if one flees
         from a fight simply to escape, all player-killers know that
         both the arts of hunting and evasion require skill.  Recalling
         to avoid death, however, requires no skill at all.

Rule 2:  One must never indulge in "one hp safe room kills".  One may
         continue to hunt their target, even after the target has died,
         as long as one tick of regeneration time is given. There is no
         sport in killing one's opponent when they don't even have the
         movement points to run.  Obviously, this rule prohibits ping-
         ponging (help pingpong).

Rule 3:  One should refrain from spam stunning their opponents after they
         have died.  For example:  After player X has been player-killed,
         they leave the tavern without regenrating and attempt to stun
         player Y, dying repeatedly in an effort to wear down player Y's
         HPs and kill them.

If you wish to play by the Dark Castle House Rules, please designate that
you are doing so by putting '@' in your title.  This way all who wish
to follow these gentlemen's rules of combat will know if their opponent
is also.

Please Note: Nobody can or will be forced to follow these rules of combat.
             These rules are simply "gentlemen's rules" for those who wish
             to abide by them.  It is up to those who follow the DC House
             RULES to make sure that they themselves do not break any of
             the above rules.

Let the battle begin!

HOT POTATO
NONE
ARENA, PRIZE, TOKEN, PKILL
L: 1
E:
The Potato Arena is a special game in which people run around a
designated area and try to give each other a 'hot potato', which
explodes and pkills whoever is holding it after a random amount
of time.

How the game works:
-Wandering through the Potato Patch are a group of potato farmers
 who are more than willing to give you a nice hot potato.
-These farmers will randomly hand out potatos that are already set
 to explode.  If you the impatient type and want a potato, simply
 say 'May I have a potato?' in the same room as a farmer, and he'll
 give you one.
-Your newly received potato will explode in a random amount of time.
 The object of the game is to then pass off any hot potatos you receive
 before they explode in your hands, thus eliminating you from the game.
-The last person standing is the winner!

Rules:  1. Normal "killing" of another PC is disabled in a Potato Arena.
           The only permitted type of killing is with a hot potato.
        2. The following skills have also been disabled while in the
           Potato Arena: sneak, hide, bard songs, and all magic.
        3. When someone passes a hot potato off to you, you will receive
           a small bit of lag to deter any automated 'give-backs'.
        4. There is a 10% chance that you will drop a potato when trying
           to pass it to someone else.
        5. All active hot potatos in your inventory will vanish upon
           leaving the arena.

     may be doing other things that may or may not be mud related.

AFW: This term means "away from window".  A player character will use this
     slang term to tell people that he is currently in another window and
     is not seeing the client window for Dark Castle.

Note: There are also socials associated with both of these terms, which
      the player character may type to echo a message to all of the other
      player characters in his or room, informing them that he is not
      currently at the keyboard or at the window.

L: 1
E:
$B$2General Information$R
 
Every skill, spell, song, and ability on Dark Castle has two attributes
associated with it.  These $BREQUISITES$R are based upon the
attributes associated with the $BSKILL GROUP$R in which the ability
is placed.
 
Both of these requisite stats are valued at an equal level for each
ability.  In order to maximize your character's potential in a given
ability, improving your attributes is a must.
 
This is one of the main incentives that motivate most people to $BMETA$R
their $BATTRIBUTES$R as high as possible.
 
$B$2Ability Improvement and Requisites$R
 
The maximum to which an ability can be learned improves 1% for each
requisite attribute that is improved beyond 15 point.
 
Each class has a diversity of requisites based upon their $BSKILL GROUPS$R,
and has at least 1 or 2 requisites from every attribute.
This means that different races will be better at different areas of each
class.  Obviously, the general "theme" of a class remains intact -- mages
still have a great many "INT" based skills, barbarians have many "STR"
based skills, thieves have many "DEX" based skills, and so on.
 
$BNote:$R losing an attribute point as a result of death can affect the
level to which you have learned your skills.  For example, if you had
improved your dexterity to a point that allowed perfecting of your
backstab skill and then died and lost a point of dexterity, your backstab
ability, as well as any dexterity based skills, could well be affected.

improvement system include:

E:
Beginning at level 20, you have a chance to lose one of your
stats when you die at the hands of a mob.  For most races,
except trolls, the main stat loss is in constitution.  However,
there is also a small chance that you will lose another stat in
addition to the stat you've already lost.  The higher the level
of mob you die to, the higher the odds of losing a stat are.
Ie. You lose one CON point and one point of WIS.

If any of your stats go below 5, your character will be

REALKILL, DEATH, STAT LOSS
L: 1
E:
During your adventures, you may stumble upon an unfortunate, but
essential, facet of life in Dark Castle: the Death Trap.

A death trap, or DT as it is often called, is a room that may
contain any number of extremely hostile mobiles that are virtually
100% guaranteed to kill you. There generally aren't any exits
or readily available escape paths from such traps.

Death traps may be found either built into certain areas
throughout the realms of Dark Castle, or perhaps constructed
by nefarious mortals.  Death traps that are a designed part of
an area (meaning not made by a player moving mobs) will generally
be accompanied by some kind of warning in description of the rooms
adjacent to the trap.  These traps are also generally, though not
exclusively, found in higher level areas.

Note: An example of a death trap (that won't in fact rkill
      you) may be found in the arena. On the bottom floor
      of the arena there is a room without any exits that
      contains Mothra, Godzilla, and Gamera.  This is a
      "fun" example of the death traps that you may stumble
      into on DC if you aren't careful.

ROUTER

SHARED LINK
NETWORK
GATEWAY
RULES, MULTI, LINK, BOT
L: 1
E:
There have been an increase in the number of DC players who participate
from a computer lab, shared link, or router with friends or other
players.  Because this can infringe upon the "help MULTI" rules,
there are the following guidelines and stipulations should you wish
to play from a shared link.

1) *All* persons who are playing via any kind of shared link or
   IP, even if the actual IPs are not identical, are responsible for
   registering with the immortal staff.  A log and registry of these
   players will be kept in order to prevent abuse of the system.

2) BOTH players MUST be at the keyboard and active.  This means
   you can't have one person on autojoin who is watching porn
   while the other person leads the group.

3) Differing from "help MULTI", extended AFK when more than
   one connection is linked to the game is ILLEGAL.
   This means you can NOT have someone sitting idle in tavern
   for hours on end if there is another person from your link
   playing.

4) Also differing from "help MULTI", you may not have multiple
   connections where one is an active player and the other is
   rolling a character.  If you are going to roll a character,
   even if you are a registered router user, you may only have
   ONE active connection to the game.

5) It is the responsibility of the PLAYER to monitor and be aware
   who is connected from your router/IP.  Yes, it may theoretically
   be possible that someone else at your school or lab may play DC
   without you knowing about it, but the likelyhood is very slim.

The bottom line is, while the Immortal staff does not want to limit
the number of potential players playing the game, we also WILL
enforce the rules and ensure that multiplaying is not occurring.
Again, it is the responsibility of registered shared link players
to monitor their simultaneous activity to make sure it complies with
policy. Please enjoy the game and follow what small rules there are.

Direct questions about this policy to Urizen or Apocalypse.
To register your router please email:

IMMUNE
SUSCEPT
SUSCEPTIBLE
RESIST
RESISTS
SAVES
L: 1
E:
Immune: Mobiles on Dark Castle can be immune to all types of damage,
        whether magical, physical, spiritual, or vocal. When a mob
        is immune to an attack, either the attack will not register
        the damage, or the attack is simply brushed off and ignored.

Susceptible: Both mobiles and players can be susceptible to certain
             kinds of attacks, thereby causing increased damage. For
             player characters, if your 'Save Vs. X' percentage falls
             into the negative, then you become susceptible to that
             kind of damage.

Resist: As with susceptibility, both mobiles and players have the
        ability to resist certain kinds of attacks, thereby reducing
        that attack's damage. For player characters, the 'Save vs X'
        number on 'score' represents your % chance of resisting that
        kind of damage.

BATMAN FOREVER
BATMAN

BANANAS, LACTAID, POETRY
L: 1
E:
Batman Forever is the 2nd bomb sequel of Batman.  In this one, Batman has
to fight off the Riddler and Two Face.  Of course, the Riddler is created
in the movie just like every other movie based on a comic.  Robin is
introduced in the movie series in this one, and when you first see him,
he's wearing tight spandex!  Dr. Chase is Batman's new love in this
sequel.  Her name is Chase cuz she chases after Batman.  I thought she
was Dr. Chaste because she never was in a sex scene in the entire movie,
but she wore all these exposing clothes, if they are clothes.

The plot:

Oki, it starts off with Mr. E showing Bruce round the factory, and some
loser asks Bruce to sponsor some project that makes you feel like you
are in the TV.  Bruce says Fuck, no, well those weren't his exact words,
but I'm sure that was what he meant.  What's his face then seduces, I
mean, knocks out Mr. Enigma, sux out his brain power, and kills Enigma.
Yipee.  According to the tapes though, Enigma committed suicide.  Then
Bruce goes off on his very first date with Dr. Chase to the very
romantic circus.  Two Face is there and slightly off sets the romantic
setting with machine guns and a mob of bad guys.  He also has some bomb,
that Robin throws out, but he's not Robin yet, and his family died,
with a splat.  Then Robin stayed in Bruce's house for a while.  Robin
was gonna leave, but Bruce stopped him by offering him one of his toys.
So Robin stayed.  He found the Batmobile in the Batcave using the
secret Batdoor, and the Batcomputer noticed because Batsecurity System
was tripped by Robin.  It shouted Intruder Alert, but didn't do
anything, just like car alarms.  So Robin took the Batmobile for a
spin, found a mob who was harrassing some girl, he saved her, beat the
crap out of the mob, and kissed the girl.  Then an even bigger mob came,
armed with cheapo plastic flashlights.  Of course, Robin panicked,
because he knew that if there were 5000 dogs could easily kill a level
fifty player, so he ran away, and Batman saved him from the mob of
scary people.  Robin blamed Batman.  Then nothing of importance
happened, except Dr. Chase was kidnapped, and Batman and Robin (in
Rubbermaid armor) went off to save her, blah blah blah.  That's the end
of the movie, except for some pointless very pathetic scene where
Batman and Robin ran, whoopee.

E:
Lactaid (pronounced lact-aid) is some type of medicine that contains
lactase (pronounced lack-taze).  Lactase is an enzyme that digests
lactose (pronounced lack-tose), which is found in dairy products.  Some
people don't have lactaid, so the bacteria in their colons digests the
lactose.  The bacteria then produces hydrogen sulfate, in other words,
they fart.

E:
Bananas are yellow fruits, and are best when they are yellow.  First they
start off green, then yellow (which is the time to eat em), then brown
(which is the time to use them for something like cake).  When man first
studied this fruit, it occurred to him, How the heck do you get the banana
inside the peel?  This question is still debated today.  There are many
theories how the banana gets inside the peel.

One theory is that the banana actually comes in a tube (like the ones
toothpaste come in) and feels like toothpaste.  Then they take an empty
peel, and squeeze the actual banana into the peel, and then seal the peel
by gluing it together with a rare type of glucose.

Another theory is that the banana comes in a liquid form, and is put into
the peel, then frozen.  It becomes moist later, after about ten years.

A not-so-well-known fact about bananas is that there is a part of them
that can be smoked to provide a significant high.  By peeling the banana
and then scraping the inside layer of the peel, one can get enough
scrapings of that layer to gather together and put out in the sun to dry.
Once dry, these scrapings can be wrapped and smoked to provide a high
similar to that of smoking pot.

ABBREVIATION
NONE
NONE
NONE
KEYWORDS
L: 1
E:
In general, you may abbreviate many things you type as you explore the
world.
 
Specifically, you may abbreviate:
     commands
     names of living beings (ie, players and mobs)
     spells
     directions (either as arguments, or commands)
 
But not names of items or objects, or helpfile topics
(unless the help topic has been specifically setup to allow a logical
sounding abbreviation, such as PFE for PROTECTION FROM EVIL)
 
For example:
     If the long version of a command is:
     cast 'invisibility' tarrasque
 
     "cast" is the command, " 'invisibility' " is the spell,
     and "tarrasque" is an argument (name of mob in this case)
 
     you can abbreviate this to:
     ca 'invis' tarr
----------------------------------
 
Example 2:
     If the long version of a command is:
     cast 'invisibility' carton
     "carton" is an argument (name of an item in this case)
 
     you can abbreviate this with:
     ca 'invisi' carton
but not
     ca 'invisi' cart
----------------------------------
 
Example 3:
     If the long version of a command is:
     enter tent
     "enter" is the command,
     and "tent" is an argument (name of an object in this case)
 
     you can abbreviate this with:
     ent tent
but not
     enter ten   or   ent te
----------------------------------
 
Example 4:
     If the long version of a command is:
     help protection from evil
     "help" is the command,
     and "protection from evil" is an argument
     (name of a help topic in this case)
 
     you can abbreviate this with:
     h pfe         (pfe is a logical sounding abbrevation for it.)
but not
     h protec       which would result in:
                   There is no help on that word.
----------------------------------
 
Example 5:
A common trick that people play on newbies is that they tell the newbie
that they can get help from the meta guy by going to the meta shop and
saying "hi" to the meta guy by typing: "hi meta".
 
Note that "hi" in the command position is an abbreviation for "hit"
this would result in the newbie attempting to hit a mob named meta.
 
Not a good idea.
Though if you fall for this trick, the likely result in the big picture
should be simple embarrasment and nothing more, as you probably did not
leave a corpse when you died.  (I would like to think that newbies level
10 and higher do not fall for this trick.)
----------------------------------
 
Example 6:
     look north
and
     north
can both be abbreviated as:
     l n
and

The affects of numerous reflect abilities WILL stack with each other
thus allowing a higher chance of reflecting a spell.

CLASSES, SKILLS, ARROWS, ARROW ENCHANTMENTS
L: 1
E:
Archery is the taking of long pointy things, and propelling them at
someone you don't like with another long pointy thing with a string
attached to it.  These things are often called 'bows and arrows', but
we try to stay away from such obscure names.  This skill is best
performed by rangers, though some other classes have access to it.
The range of a propelled long pointy thing is currently one room.
To successfully propel long pointy things, a player must be holding
an object capable of propelling long pointy things.  (S)He must be
wearing a quiver that has long pointy things in it.

Syntax:  fire [target] [direction] [enchantment]

(direction) being in which direction you would like the long pointy
things propelled.  North, South, etc.

[enchantment]s are spells that a ranger can use on an arrow to
radically enhance its performance.  These are optional, and cost
the ranger a substantial amount of mental energy.  Different spells
do different things.

(target) is the he/she/it that you don't like, and wish to propel
long pointy things at.

CAUTION:  Children under the age of 16 should not be allowed to use
long pointy things without adult supervision.

Archery:
A quiver is an item used to hold arrows, or, as they are more commonly
called, long pointy things.  For use in archery, they must be worn
either 'about body' or 'on waist'.  They generally work better if they
are filled with these long pointy things for propelling at a later time.
Also read 'help arrowenchantments' to learn about rangers can augment
their arrows with various magical enchantments.

Monks:
This ancient ritual allows a monk to emit vibrations that will severly
damage their opponent, rending a full half of their life force from them.
Due to its immense power, it costs the monk using it a significant amount
of ki, and no objects can be held while performing the action. This skill
can only be used once every 12 (mud) hours.

CREATE GOLEM
GOLEM
GOLEMSCORE
NONE
NONE
RELEASE GOLEM
L: 1
E:
Over the ages, mages have learned the art of creating artificial
life using the a wide array of magical components.  This art
is an extremely difficult one to master and requires many years of
extensive study and hard work.  This spell is so completely draining
on the caster, that it requires certain items as reagents for the
spell.  Suggestions for possible components can be gleaned from the
wisdom of the Mage's Guildmaster. Once a golem is created it remains
tied to its master and its spirit can be "released" to a pocket dimension
until called upon again.  Each casting to call upon or create a golem
requires the mage have all the correct components in their inventory.
The successful creation of a golem creates a strong magical creature
loyal only to its creator.  While this golem is unable to combat other
well known denizens of the realms (players) they have no difficulty
applying a savage beating to any creatures the mage may encounter (mobs).
There are even stories of some rare essences with special magical
abilities that can further enhance a golem beyond its normal scope.
Once a golem has been created it is linked to the mage and will
unfailingly follow orders. The mage will also be unable to rid itself
of the bond with its golem unless it is slain or released by the mage
themself. If a golem is released it retains any equipment it was wearing
at the time as well as any experience it has gained.  If a golem is
slain, its equipment falls to the ground and its spirit is released until
called upon once again.
The powers of a golem build over time (they can level up and save with
you). In order for a golem to receive XP it must be in the same room as
the mob that the golem owner kills. For example, if the owner kills a mob in
a different room than the golem, the golem will not receive XP from the
kill.  Also, should a golem be slain be it by a mortal (player) or
creature (mob) the golem's power will return to that of a previous state.
(If your golem gets killed, it sometimes loses a level and goes back to 0
experience).  Furthermore, if the golem's master is rkilled, the golem
may also suffer such adverse effects, viz. a percentage chance of a 
level loss.
The "golemscore" command can be used while your golem is with you to view
its current statistics.
Syntax:   cast 'create golem' stone
          cast 'create golem' iron
          (must have correct components in inventory)
          golemscore

your amalgam of living corpses or flaming elementals in tow as an
entourage.

Some say those Paladins that have reverted to the service of evil can
request favors from the nether in the form of travel.  How can one explain
the sometimes-supernatural lengths a murderous dark Knight will go to
wrench the life from a victim, otherwise?
 
An uttered malediction from an Anti-Paladin's blasphemous lips will
mark the soil with the undetectable taint of evil.  The spot will glow
with a light so gaunt it may not illuminate, yet with another word the
Anti-Paladin will be drawn back to the site in the space of a heartbeat--
as if it was the brightest of lanterns.  Only the most sacred ground may
repel this mark (safe rooms, clan halls, guild rooms).
 
As the world is reborn, these marks do not remain in place.  "Beacon"
by itself will set the place, but the spell must be intoned to return to
the aforementioned location.
 
Syntax:   beacon (to set the location of the spell)

Note: Using beacon across different continents will incurr additional
casting costs and an increased chance of failure.

E:
This spell will remove one non-combat utility spell from a victim, such
as fly, detect good, and the like.  It will not remove the more offense
or defense-based ones such as PFE, Sanctuary, etc.
 
It can also be employed to remove minor incantations or spells from objects
or sometimes within a room.  For example, it can remove invisibility that has
been cast upon an object, as well as several others.

Some of the most experienced mages have found unexpected uses for this
spell. Experiment and you may too.
 
Syntax:   cast 'dispel minor' <target>
 
Note:     At higher levels, this spell often has the ability to target
          specific spells on a victim, though its effectiveness is much

E:
Using keen natural senses for nature, and intuition for herbs and
fauna, druids and rangers are able to roam about foraging for a variety
of foods, components, and ingredients to their own potions and salves.
The forager never knows what will be found, for it is dependent on what
natural habitat or $BSECTOR$R they are foraging within.
 
Strange and magical powers and poisons are known to some, as well as
rare herbs and healing poultices.  Sometimes the forager will even
procure goods that $BASSEMBLE$R into other useful objects.
 
The cost is in movement points, as the ranger or druid may have to
forage widely for these components.  What will be turned up and its
relative value is directly proportional to the character's forage
abilities.
 
The following sectors each have different objects that can be foraged:
- swamp
- beach
- water (swim and no_swim alike)
- forest
- field/hills
- mountains
- desert
- tundra/arctic
 
The sectors: air, underwater, city, paved_road, and inside, as well as
any "safe" or "clan" room will not produce foragable goods.

There are also a few skills and spells (skewer and creeping death for 2)
that have a chance to instantly slay their victim.
 
For PvP backstab purposes, bingo % is calculated based upon the following:
1) You must be equal or higher level than your victim to have a chance
   to bingo them.
2) If meet criteria #1 there is always a 1% minimum chance of success.
3) If you have the same or greater maximum hitpoint than your victim you
   have the traditional 5% chance of a bingo to occur on backstab.
4) For every 15% less maximum hp you have than your victim you suffer
   a 1% penalty to your bingo chance (1% min remains).
 
The only restriction for a backstab bingo on a mob is you must be within
20 levels of the mob to be able to bingo it (no bingo'ing Heph).

At level 50, there are two important changes to how "real deaths" can
affect your character.
 
$B1)$R Your corpse can be looted of any gold coins it contains and ONE item
(total) by other players.  This action will result in the looting player
receiving a "DIRTY_THIEF" or "GOLD_THIEF" flag (see help $BPTHIEF$R).
 
$B2)$R Your corpse can only be looted as described above if YOU are level
50 or over AND the person attempting to loot it is level 50 or over.
 
Corpses cannot be looted in this manner if they are in a $BSAFE$R room.

$B$3FOR NEW PLAYERS:$R After level 20, your corpse can be purchased intact

PING PONG

HELP, RULES
L: 1
E:
The rule against ping-ponging is, at its core, inherently vague.
That being said, however, it is possible to formulate it generally
as follows:

"To pingpong a player is to participate (by yourself or with others)
in the repeated pkilling of a player with a CANTQUIT flag while they 
are either in the Tavern or in the room they set as their home, before
they have regenerated any movement points.  This is very illegal and 
subject to freezing because it annoys the gods."

While it is difficult to quantify exactly what 'repeatedly' is, the  
general rule of thumb is that "you know it when you see it".  Spamming
up the information channel with continuous pkills is generally regarded
as pingponging, while three, four, or even five pkills may not be.  In
other words, the basic idea here is that the flagged individual does not
have a chance to run and hide if they are constantly pkilled before a
tick of movement regeneration passes.

However, there is also a burden on the person with the CQ to find a
place to safely hide off their flag.  If you engage in pkilling, the
CQ flag is a consequence for your actions, in that it enables others
to pkill you in a safe-room.  So, while it is illegal for others to
repeatedely send you back and forth between saferooms before you have
a chance to regenerate any movement, it is up to you leave that safe-
room and find a place to hide off your CQ.  One may not simply use
the rule against pingponging to allow them to regenerate safely in
the Tavern.

In summation: the act of pingponging occurs when a player with a CQ
is repeatedly pkilled before a tick of movement regeneration passes,
sending them back and forth between the Tavern and their home, all
the while spamming up the information channel.

This rule requires a great deal of common sense.  So please, use some
common sense before accusing someone of pingponging.  If you don't have
any common sense, then ask someone who does.

HELP
L: 1
E:
Lag is basically when the game is running slowly.  It
can be machine based, net based, or local lag.  When machine
lag is happening, all of the players on the game experience the
same lag, so the game runs slowly for everyone.  While this is
boring it is no particular danger to you.  Net lag and local lag
may affect only you.  The game runs at normal speeds, and
is constantly sending you information, but for whatever reason
it takes a while for your screen to display that info.  That is
potentially dangerous, as actions can take place in the game that
you do not know are occurring until several minutes after they
occur.  Examples of local lag are when your screen freezes, then
scrolls a lot of data by at once.  Machine lag is evidenced by a
slowly responding mud.  The gods have little power over lag, though
they may do their best to ease it by silencing anyone gossiping
too much about how much they dislike it.

Some ways to reduce lag in-MUD:
1) Toggle compact on
2) Toggle ansi color off
3) Turn of unnecessary channels
4) Use a smaller prompt

If none of these work, consider logging out so that other players can
take advantage of your bandwidth. ;)

ALIGNMENT
ALIGN
GOOD
EVIL
NEUTRAL
PFE, PFG, CLASSES, SKILLS
L: 1
E:
On DC your alignment defines how good or evil you are on
a scale of 1000 to -1000.  If your alignment is between 1000
and 351 you are 'good'; +350 and -350 you are 'neutral' and
-351 to -1000 you are evil.  Alignment effects most people by
the equipment they wear.  If you are 'good', you can not
equip an anti_good equipment item.  In the same way if you

are neutral and become evil when fighting a mob, all of your
anti_evil flagged equipment will fall off.  Your alignment
generally changes by the mobs you kill.  Kill a good mob and
you become evil.  Certain classes (Paladin, Anti-Paladin) will
lose abilities if their alignment becomes unfavorable.

L: 1
E:
All GL or god-load equipment can be purchased at the Platinum
Smiths or Merchants who are scattered about the realm.
When purchasing equipment from them keep in mind that it is
not transferable from character to character.

Also while god load can't be scrapped it certainly can be
damaged, and reselling damaged god load back to the platinum
smith lowers its value drastically. You are advised to first
repair it before reselling.

Reimbursements for selling damaged god load are not given.

PLATINUM, CONSENT, RDEATH, VALUE, DEATH
L: 1
E:
Sometimes an over-ambitious adventurer finds his or her corpse
quickly becoming room temperature after trying to attack
an all too powerful monster. Or you die in lands too distant
to return to before the scavengers devour your corpse.

It is times like this one needs to hire the services of an
undertaker. An undertaker can recover your corpse for a
nominal fee, usually equal to the cost of all the equipment that
you carry. Additionally, any other player which you have 'consented'
will be able to purchase your corpse from the Undertaker.

Once you die, you will have a limited amount of time in which to
purchase your corpse, because after so long the maggots will
have consumed so much of your corpse that not even the undertaker
wants to touch it.

Of course you can always ask a fellow player to attempt to
retrieve your corpse for you by requesting a 'CR' or 'corpse
retrieval'. Should you find someone brave enough to take the
same path that lead to your demise you need to give them
permission to touch your corpse (with the consent command).

If you decide to purchase your corpse from the Undertaker, you must
get the eq off the corpse quickly, or you stand a chance of loosing it
all in a crash or reboot.

You can also use the value command to get an estimate on your corpse
price.

E:
Choosing a name is a sacred thing, the gods dislike changing
names. In order to convince one of the gods that you deserve a
name change, you need to sacrifice 500 plats to the cause.
 
This means choose a name you like when you first start your
character. Those who purchase their characters, you need to
figure the cost of the name change into the purchase price,
or live with name.
 
A name swap between two or more characters still costs
500 plats per character whose name is changed.
 
The immortal changing your name will not provide either a
gender or sex change as these can ONLY be purchased at the
temple in Sorpigal.
 
Politely contact an Implementor for a name change and have
your 500 plats ready.

PASSWORD

PASSWORDS
NONE
NONE
ARBITRATION, IMPERSONATE, RULES, MULTI
L: 1
E:
At Dark Castle, you are held responsible for the security and actions of
your own characters.  We have put the mechanism in place for safety
already...it is the PLAYER's option to exercise it, and the player takes
ALL responsibility for such a decision.  If your character ever cheats,
gives away platinum, erases themselves, etc, you will be held FULLY
responsible for those actions because you either:
1) Did it yourself.
2) Gave out your password.
3) Used an easy to guess password.
   Either way, it is your fault.  IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS
HELP FILE, YOU WILL NOT EVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THIS HAPPENING TO YOU.
What happens now is up to YOU, *not* the gods.

The first way to protect your characters is to have a secure password.
Below is some suggestions we have made up for protecting your password:

     1. The password is not the same as the character name, nor does it
        contain the character name in the password.
     2. The password should be 6 to 8 letters in length. It should have
        at least one upper and one lower case character, one numeral [0-9]
        and at least one symbol.
     3. The password should also should not be a word, acronym or anything
        else that can easily be guessed.
     4. Your password on Dark Castle should be different from your
        accounts at school or your internet provider, and especially keep
        a different password on every mud you play at. That way if someone
        cracks your account at one site they can't break into other
        systems.
     5. Your password should be changed every couple of months. Every
        quarter would not be a bad idea.
     6. Protect your password from the prying eyes of your neighbors.
     7. Do NOT let ANYONE ELSE know your password.  This includes friends,
        relatives, clan members, etc.  I'm sure you trust your buddy, but
        the bottom line is that you are PUTTING YOURSELF IN THE LINE OF
        FIRE by doing this.  No one thought it would happen to them until
        it was too late...
     8. DO NOT GIVE YOUR PASSWORD TO ANYONE WHO ASKS FOR IT.  This
        includes gods.  If a god really needed to use your character
        (and I can't imagine why that would be) there is a command
        they can use to do so.  More than likely anyone asking for the
        password is impersonating a god (see help impersonate).  Ignore
        any threats of zappage or bodily harm from such a person. Log
        the interaction and mail it to your favorite implementer.
     9. Any instance in which you allow your password to be captured by
        a computer program, such as a mud client, you are in danger of
        it being stolen by whatever means.  We are not responsible for
        your computer's security.

Please do not ask for a reimbursement in a case of a stolen character.  If
your character becomes corrupted due to a bug, that is different, but if
you follow the rules listed above you will never, ever have to worry about
this.  If you don't follow them, it's your own damn fault.

Special note:  Even if you forget your password, these rules apply.  We
will not give out character passwords, whether you forgot it or the
character was stolen from you, or whatever else happens.  The only way to
prove legal ownership of a character is to have its password.  There is
no other way to convince us 100%, period.

Passwords are YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!

HELP, CLASSES, SKILLS, EQUIPMENT
L: 1
E:
Damage dealt by the various skills and spells at a player's disposal
is directly related to how well the player has learned the ability.
For example, if your "fireball" spell is only learned to the level of
"average" expect it to only do about 50% of the potential maximum for
the spell.  Spells and skills will never do less than 50% of their
potential maximum, no matter how poorly you have learned the ability.
 
When in combat, you will see a damage message with each hit.  Here is a
listing of the various messages you get, in order of least damage to most
damage.
 
    1-2 = tickle
    3-5 = scratch
    6-9 = graze
  10-14 = hit
  15-19 = hits hard
  20-25 = hits very hard
  26-31 = hits damn hard
  32-39 = pummel
  40-49 = massacre
  50-59 = annihilate
  60-69 = obliterate
  70-79 = cremate
  80-94 = decimate
 95-109 = mangle
110-129 = eviscerate
130-149 = beat the shit
150-174 = BEAT THE LIVING SHIT
175-204 = POUND THE FUCK
205-249 = FUCKING DEMOLISH
250-299 = TOTALLY FUCKING DISINTEGRATE
300-999 = ABSOLUTELY FUCKING ERADICATE
  1000+ = top secret
  
There is also a "toggle damage" option available that will provide you
with numerical output in addition to standard damage messages should you
feel like specifics over "realism".

CLANHALLS
CHALL
CINFO, CLAN TOTEM, CLAN VAULT, CLAN PRICES, CLAN GUARD
L: 1
E:
Clan Halls are a place where members of a specific clan can meet, relax,
make home, and be safe.  They are the only rooms outside of towns and
guilds in which it is possible to set "home".

Clan Halls are only available once a clan is established and clan fee paid.
There are also a wide range of additional fees associated with the
creation and installation of a clan hall.  See "help CLAN PRICES" for
specific costing information.

Clan Halls each have a guard which, as long as it lives, will only let
members of that clan pass into the hall.  Clan halls may only have one
"in world" room for their entrance and/or exit.  They can however, have
more than one way inside the hall leading to said room.

A clan hall may be located within the city limits of any designated
"town", off of a major roadway, or within any "linking area".
(ask an immortal for specific examples)

Each clan's hall also has a Clan Totem in a special room inside.
(see "help CLAN TOTEM")

Clan Halls can also contain a Clan Vault where a certain number of items
can be stored and accessed only by members.
(see "help CLAN VAULT")

CLAN TOTEMS
TOTEMS
CLAN HALL, CLAN VAULT, CLAN PRICES, CLAN GUARD, CLANS
L: 1
E:
Clan Totems are a special object that represents the theme or "essence"
of a clan.  While they are placed within a special "altar" that resides
in each clan's hall, all members of a clan gain a bonus. (outlined below)

If a clan's totem is removed from the altar, the bonus is removed.  If a
clan places a totem stolen from another clan in their altar they gain the
bonus from that totem in addition to bonuses from any others already
inside. After a reboot or a crash the totem will reset in the original
clanhall.

For example, if Smoke Jaguars totem gives +1 fire-saves to all clan members
and it is stolen by DC Guard, Smoke Jaguars would lose their +1 fire-saves
bonus.  If DC Guard then placed the stolen totem in their altar, they would
gain +1 fire-saves plus the bonuses from any other totems already inside.

Totems are included in the initial clan hall cost.
Changing the effect of your clan's totem costs 2000 platinum.

Available totem effects are:
+1 to any attribute (str, con, dex, wis, int)
+1 to any save-effect (fire, cold, acid, poison, magic, energy)
-10 bonus to Armor-Class
+1 to-hit bonus
+1 to hit-point or mana regeneration
+2 to movement regeneration

Note also that each clan's altar can contain up to 10 weight in totem items.
All clan totems have 0 weight (thus, there is no limit to how many CLAN
totems can be placed in an altar -- other totems have weight restrictions.)

$BNote:$R
Some items can be found in the world of varying weights (1 to 10) that have
additional affects and can be taken from a mob and put in the clan altar.
You will have to choose wisely as to which 10 weight worth of totems to fill
your clan's altar with.

E:
In conjunction with the "vault" system for characters (see $Bhelp VAULT$R),
your clan can also purchase a vault for shared use amongst its members.

Clan vaults and additional space for clan vaults can be purchased from
the vault salesman in Sorpigal.

Note that a clan member must have the "vault" clan right in order to
access their clan's vault. (see $Bhelp CLAN RIGHTS$R)

Members with clan vault rights can also make the initial vault purchase
for their clan as well as purchase additional clan vault space for
their clan.
 
Note: when depositing or removing items or gold from a clan vault 
use the word "clan" in lieu of a players name.

For example: vault put etala clan

You cannot place GODLOAD or NO_TRADE items into a clan vault.

Wimpy can be a very useful command at times.  When it is on, your
character will automatically flee from battle when you get below a certain
percentage of your total hitpoints.  Simply type toggle wimpy to activate.
Beware though, for sometimes it may cause you to flee into a situation
even more worse than the one you were in.
 
The advantage to having wimpy off is that combat-induced lag is reduced if
your foe dies or flees while you're incapacitated (lagged).

EMAIL, RULES, IMMORTAL, CREDITS, CONTRIBUTE
L: 1
E:
We are always accepting applications.  Please email them to the
world coordinator.  PROOFREAD them too, or they will be rejected.
This should go without saying.

If you are wanting to build, you first must create a sample of what you
can do.  This must be 5-10 room descriptions, at least 3-5 lines in length
each. You should also include a mob or 2, and perhaps an object
description.  It should be based on an area slated for overhaul (help AREAS),
be neat and free of typos, and be extraordinary enough to convince
the world imps to free up a zone for you. Also keep in mind that you
are required to sacrifice a level 50 character to immort.

Applications that do not include a building sample like above
WILL NOT EVEN BE READ.  It doesn't matter how many other immortals
you've had on other MUDs, or how many times you've previously been
an immortal on DC (kind of makes us wonder why you got zapped in
the first place).  You MUST include YOUR work.

Combat is the main focus of the mud.  Killing mobs is the main way to
advance in levels, and better your character.  Combat can be started
in several ways, depending on your character class.  Any class can
start combat with the kill command, while other classes may choose
to start combat with a spell, or skill such as backstab, kick, or
stun, etc...

After combat has started, you also have a choice of things to
do.  You can use your class's various battle skills, such as kick,
or cast spells.  Note that when you are in combat, you do not have to
specify a name after the skill or spell.  You will automatically cast
or direct your skill at the mob (or player) you are fighting.

If things get rough during the fight, you can choose to flee, or
another helpful means of escape, recall.

receive a CANTQUIT flag for pstealing or attacking someone or attacking
their charmed mobile.  If you are affected by a CANTQUIT, you will not be
able to quit, nor will you be safe from attacks in a safe room.  CANTQUIT
flags expire in five ticks unless you get into another playerfight and
hit back before the fight ends.  In this case the CANTQUIT flag will be
reset back to five ticks.
 
If you attempt to recall while affected by CANTQUIT, you will be placed
in the tavern, rather than in your home.

L: 1
E:
Attacking and killing another player is known as pkilling.  This is legal
on DC, but should you choose to attack another player, you will be
given a $BCANTQUIT$R flag.  A pkilled player loses nothing.  They will not
leave a corpse (unless flagged a thief, see $BHELP PTHIEF$R) and lose no
experience points.
 
Attacking a player while he or she is fighting a mobile or otherwise
trying to take advantage of game mechanics in order to cause a real
death (see $BHELP RK$R) is legal on Dark Castle MUD, but it won't make you
very popular.
 
In terms of pkill stats on your '$BSCORE$R' sheet, a player kill only counts
if the victim's level over 10 and is not linkdead.
 
Furthermore, killing someone more than 20 levels below you that does not
already have a CANTQUIT flag will result in the LOSS of a PK point from
your scoresheet.
 
If a player more than 20 levels below you has a CANTQUIT or attacks
you first, you will NOT lose a PK point for killing them and may in 
fact gain one depending on their level.
 
Pkill statistics are also tracked on the Dark Castle "$BLEADERBOARD$R".

CINFO, OUTCAST, ACCEPT, RIGHTS, CTELL, CLAN PRICES
L: 1
E:
Clans consist of one clan leader and as many members as the leader wishes
to have.  Clans generally have basic policies and rules, but that is all
up to the leader of the clan.  Clans are helpful because you have fellow
members to group with, to help out, and be helped out by, and clans also
serve to give you a strong sense of belonging.  For a listing of all clans
and their current leader, type 'clans.'

There are a limited number of slots for clans.  If it comes to a choice
between two clans when installing new ones, the clan which is serious
enough about its existence to invest in a clan hall will be given
preference.  Inactive clans may be removed to make way for new ones.
Clans cannot be bought or sold.  If you buy the leader of the clan, you
are buying the clan.  Should this become known to the clan god the clan
may be removed.  Should you purchase a character that is IN a clan but not
the leader, your fate will be decided by the leader of said clan.

To start a new clan you require 1 level 50 character.  You no longer require
any additional people as you can simply clan (or not clan) people as you see fit.

The cost of starting a new clan is 2,000 platinum coins.  Additional items
such as a clan hall or a clan guard outlined in the several other clan
helpfiles, many listed below.

E:
Clan leaders are granted special abilities to organize their clan and do
various other nifty things. They can be accessed by the leader typing the
'clan' command and are explained as follows:

clan list        - gives the normal output of the 'clan' command,
                   the list of all other clans on the mud
clan email       - allows the leader to change the
                   email displayed by 'cinfo'
clan description - allows the leader to change description in 'cinfo'

clan rights *    - allows leader to impart abilities upon other members
clan motd        - changes clan message of the day, which is displayed
                   to all clan members when logging in right below
                   the MUD motd (or when typing: cmotd)
clan help        - shows this stuff

  clan rights <member> <right>. These rights are as follows:

accept    - allows member to accept new members into the clan
outcast   - allows member to outcast members from the clan
read      - allows member to read messages on clan message board
write     - allows member to write new messages on clan board
remove    - allows member to erase messages, other than their own, from
            clan message board. All members can remove their own message
            by default.
member    - allows member to view clan roster by typing: clan members
rights    - allows member to impart rights upon other members. This can
            only be used to give rights which imparting member already
            has.
messages  - allows member to change login, logout, and death messages
info      - allows member to change clan email, description, and motd
tax       - allows member to set the clan's tax percentage.
withdraw  - allows the member to withdraw gold from the clan's bank
            account.
vault     - allows the member access to the clan vault
vaultlog  - allows viewing of vaults transactions
log       - allows viewing of clan bank account transactions
area      - allows member to use clanarea commands
channel   - allows member to use the clan channel

Note that if you accidently have a space after the right when you do:
clans rights <member> <right>, as in: "clans rights Joebob info"

This will result in a "right not found" error.
If you are doing lots of names as a batch, reading in from a file, your
client will likely send the literal space to the mud if you do have a
space at the of the line.

MONK, BARD, SING
L: 1
E:
Ki is the energy of nature that can only be harnessed effectively by a
monk. Throughout the ages, several abilities have been developed by the
ancient monk elders which allow a monk to use spirit of nature around
them.  It will not work in safe rooms.

Ki is also the source for the songs of bards. Some bard songs will only
only deplete the bard's Ki source once: when the song is first begun;
other songs are more draining and will deplete ki at constant intervals
while the song is in progress.

KI, MONK
L: 1
E:
Ki energy is often channeled to bring about acts of necessary violence.
While the name indicates chaos and unpredictability, this is not the
case.  The Monk simply focuses the energy internally, serving as a
spiritual beacon.  Those too close to the practitioner are immediately
distraught with an internal conflict, wracked with pain and exposed to
the judgment of the monk.  The disciple may not be distracted by combat,
lest the Ki energies diffuse.  At times, the energy drawn inward may be
so intense that minor miracles can occur. This Ki power is considered
peaceful (?!?!) and may not be used in safe rooms.

Syntax:   ki storm

L: 1
E:
During the travels of a practitioner of the fighting arts, one is
expected to suffer the contaminations afflicted by nature, as well
as civilization.  These take many forms, but one skilled in the use
of Ki as a purgatory measure may eliminate these pollutions from the
body.  No more does the student need rely on the promises of snake-oil
vendors or the gestures and invocations of false prophets.

L: 1
E:
Many fighters lash out blindly to work their styles harder than their
bodies allow.  The inclusion of Ki energies in order to gain speeds
unmatched only through magic is far superior.  Practitioners can
channel the Ki flow into their body and shoulders, giving such fluidity
to their strikes that their opponents seem rigid.  The disciple may lash
out as quickly as once before, when members of the order relied on magical
artifice to empower them.

KI DISRUPT
DISRUPT
NONE
NONE
NONE
KI, MONK, DISPEL MAGIC, DISARMING LIMMERICK
L: 1
E:
Ki may be channeled in such a way to struggle against the magical
energies surrounding one's foe.  The practitioner of Disruption
temporarily removes the foe's physical body from sight, and instead
envisions the wreath of power which radiates in its stead.
 
Extending one's Ki outwards in a strike may wound or completely
impair the magical auras upon which many denizens of this world
rely for protection or offense.
 
It is not as simple as punching one's hand through a foe's chest,
so discipline must be gained before this skill is mastered.  While
perhaps not initially as effective as the dispel magic spell
employed by wizards, repeated attempts to disrupt a target will
result in a cumulative affect.  Thus, there are few, if any, who
can withstand repeated Disruption attempts.
 
Furthermore, mastery has its rewards. For at higher levels, the
practitioner has a chance to utterly disrupt their foe, removing
ALL protective or offensive auras in a single, focused strike.

KI, MONK
L: 1
E:
Monks are extremely robust combatants however many can still not physically
withstand the onslaught of an enraged barbarian. Monks have therefore
developed a way of channeling their ki to aid them in these circumstances.
The monk takes a strong defensive position and then enters a state of mind
where he imagines the strongest blows from a berserker as hurting him
no more than slap of a small goblin. For a brief length of combat,
all damage inflicted upon the monk will be greatly reduced.

PARRY, AC, WEAR, SPELLS
L: 1
E:
Shields are perhaps the most sought after item for those wishing to
increase their chances of survival in a battle. In general a shield will
greatly reduce your armor class, making you harder to hit. Shields can
be either held or worn.

Additionally, those classes who most often find themselves at the
receiving end of attacks have the ability to entirely deflect their
opponents attack, both magical and physical, with their shield. This 
skill is known as 'shield block' and is an automatic combat skill, 
but the fighter must be wearing a shield for it to work.

E:
Track <name> allows the ranger to search the surroundings for the tracks
of a specific target if that player or monster has been through the area.

For example: track Llevity

The 'track' command by itself allows any character to search for the
tracks in the same room.  Track is done by scent, so flying won't help
you.

summons the aid of stinging bees to inflict minor wounds upon a foe.
The greater the level and ability of the ranger, the greater the number
of bees that will be summoned.

Syntax:   cast 'bee sting' <target>

'Bee swarm' is a more advanced spell requiring the lore of conjuring a
swarm of bees to attack one's opponents.  Note this is an area spell
and will affect everything in room.

Imagine a quivering hoard of carnivorous insects biting, nibbling, and
attacking your opponent.  It's an unsettling scene to observe, but
effective.  There is also a slight chance that the target will
react violently with the insect venom, in which case your opponent may
become poisoned, or die instantly.

This spells efficiency is based upon the caster's surroundings (sector).
Some terrain types provide a significant boost to the size of the hoard of
attacking insects, others offer no modification, while still others can
cause a small reduction to the size of the hoard.

Over time, the ancient druids of the land learned how to cooperate
and even merge with nature.  The rangers have inherited this ability,
known as 'forest melding'.  This spell, when cast in a forest, will
literally make the casting ranger a part of his or her surroundings.
This spell is known to hide the caster from all forms of magical
seeing, even the true sight of mages and clerics.  Furthermore it
is rumored the caster can then move about the forest with the stealth
of a dryad.  The spells effects will last until the caster enters a
non-forest room, or until the duration has ended.

NEWBIE, GETTINGSTARTED, RULES, EQ, SETS
L: 1
E:
As you may note that you are stark naked, there are several ways
to remedy this.  You can pick up a near complete set of basic
equipment by killing the mobs and getting stuff from Dark Castle's
mud school, which is located up from the Albatross Tavern.  Don't
forget mud school banner (permanent light) and diploma (+wis, +con)
when you leave mud school!
 
None of these items can be sold.  Therefore it would be best
to equip yourself with these items.  You may do this with the
following commands :
 
        wear <item>     : you wear clothing/armor such as:
                                example: wear jacket
        wield <weapon>  : if you want to use any weapon you must wield it.
                                example: wield sword
        wear all        : quickly equips your character with the items in
                          your inventory.
        remove <item>   : you may also remove clothing/armor
                                example: remove jacket
 
Note: There also exists a "NEWBIE" flag for certain items which prevents
      them from being stolen or put into containers.

NEWBIE, GETTINGSTARTED, BANK
L: 1
E:
Money can be a difficult thing to come by.  As a first level, your
might be able to beg for money from some of the other more experienced
players, BUT do not expect that they will help you out.   The easiest
way to get money is by looting the corpses of the monsters you kill.

                get coins corpse        : will get the coins from the
                                          corpse

If there is more than one corpse in the same 'room' as you, then try:

                get coins 2.corpse      : which will get the coins from
                                          the second corpse, and so on

If you are in a group it would be wise to share the money taken off of
the corpses of monsters you have killed, to do that you would use:

                split <amount> coins    : will divide the amount of coins
                                          evenly among the members of your
                                          group.
                example: split 500 coins

        Also don't forget to look inside the corpses of the monsters that
        you have managed to kill. Some may have equipment that you may
        want. In order to do such a thing:

                look in corpse          : show you what your victim
                                          carried.

        Should your former opponent have better equipment just type
                get <item> corpse       : get a single item from a corpse

                get all corpse          : take all that you can carry
                                          from your former opponent

RULES, NEWBIE, GETTINGSTARTED, CHANNEL
L: 1
E:
There are several commands that can be used to help you to communicate
with other players on Dark Castle. Information on several of the most
commonly used channels is below. See "$Bhelp CHAN$R" for more information.
 
$B$2TELL:$R tell <person> <sentence>
This will send a message directly to the character specified and no one else.
 
$BSAY:$R say <sentence>
This will send a message to everyone awake in whatever room you are in.
 
$BSHOUT:$R shout <sentence>
This will send a message visible to everyone in your "area".
(Typing "$Bwhere$R" will show you anyone that is visible to you in your area.)
 
$B$5GOSSIP:$R gossip <sentence>
This will send your message to everyone in the game who is awake.
 
$B$1DREAM:$R dream <sentence>
This will send a message to everyone in the game who is asleep.
(Note this can only be used if you are asleep yourself.)
 
$B$6AUCTION:$R auction <sentence>
This is a channel that can be used for the buying and selling of goods.
(Note there is also a consignment broker ($Bhelp VEND$R) who can help you with this.)
Be aware of the information in "$Bhelp FAKESELL$R" if you're using auction.
 
$B$3TRIVIA:$R trivia <sentence>
The trivia channel is used to answer questions when the gods are holding
a trivia event.  See "$Bhelp TRIVIA$R" for more details.
 
Additionally, there is a channel dedicated solely to new players seeking help:
 
$5NEWBIE:$R newbie <sentence>
This will send a message to all players in the game who are awake.
 
Be aware that tell, gossip, auction, dream, trivia, and newbie all can be
turned off via the "channel" command. (See "$Bhelp CHAN$R" for more details.)
 
Most channels also have their own helpfile with more information.
Many public channels (i.e. gossip, auction, trivia, etc.) will also display
their last 10 messages if you enter the channel name with no arguments.
(For example, just typing "gossip" will show you the last 10 gossips.)
 
$B$4PLEASE NOTE: the newbie channel is intended for providing accurate
assistance. The immortal staff requests that veteran players keep snarky
comments, inaccurate information, and general assclownery to gossip.$R

L: 1
E:
Welcome to Dark Castle. Listed below you will find exact directions to
some of our newbie areas.  Note that all directions you can move in
(North East South West Up Down) may be abbreviated with n e s w u d.
 
All directions are from the "Albatross Tavern" which is the most popular spot
in Sorpigal, Dark Castle's primary town.  Many of these areas have a separate
"help file" associated with them.
 
Mud School:     u, n                             (read: 'help MUD SCHOOL')
Gangland:       s, 3w, 5s, e                     (read: 'help GANGLAND')

RECALL

NONE
NONE
NEWBIE, WORD OF RECALL, HOME, BEACON, SAFE
L: 1
E:
Recall is the mainstream way to get back to the tavern or any safe room of
your choice.  Should you get lost, merely type 'recall.' If you fail, keep
trying until you return magically to the tavern.  Note that this command is
only free until level 11, at which point it will begin to cost some gold
for you to be able to recall.  The amount of gold will vary upon the level
of the user.  I.e. level 12's using the recall command will get it at a much
cheaper price than a level 50 using the recall command.  Also, setting your
home in clanhalls or guilds other than your own will get you frozen and
possibly zapped.  It is illegal.  Don't do it.
 
Notes about recall:
- The recall command will NOT work if you are in a no magic (!magic) room.
- The recall command will NOT work if you are in combat with another player
  and you are striking a PLAYER (ie if you are hitting a mob and someone
  attacks you, you can still recall).
- If you have a CANTQUIT flag, you will always recall to the tavern,
  regardless of where your home is set.
 
Your "wisdom" attribute has an affect on how effective your prayers of
transportation to safety are.
 
  syntax: recall
 
Using Recall across different continents will incurr additional gold
costs and an increased chance of failure.

RULES
RULE
THE RULES
README
READ ME
MULTIPLAYING, CANTQUIT, SPAM, HARASS, ROUTER
L: 1
E:
Below you will find the regulations we require players of Dark Castle to abide
by.  Please note that while some examples of potential violations are listed,
the list is by no means exhaustive and if you are in doubt, asking an Immortal
is always the safest course of action.
 
2. $B$3Player-Killing$R - Pkilling is legal. The defeated player loses $BNOTHING$R and
   and does not leave a corpse (Unless the player is flagged thief - see rule
   #3 below for more).
  
3. $B$3Stealing$R - Players who steal from other players are automatically flagged
   "thief". A thief leaves a corpse behind when killed and it's up to the
   player who killed them whether to return the thief's belongings or keep
   them. It is illegal for a thief with a CANTQUIT and thief flag to transfer
   stolen equipment in any way as a method of doing so would be a bug (see #6
   below).  Details about stealing are further outlined in $Bhelp STEAL$R.
 
4. $B$3Cant-Quit$R - After a steal or a pkill, a person is flagged as CANTQUIT for a
   time.  This means you are unable to log out of the game during  this period
   and are $Bnot$R safe from attackers in any SAFE room.  See $Bhelp CANTQUIT$R and
   $Bhelp SAFE$R for more details.
 
5. $B$3Spamming$R - Spam of any kind is not allowed on this mud.  If you are deemed
   to be spamming on any public channel, pray, tell, emotes, socials, or
   other means, you will be silenced.  If you persist in spamming you risk
   a freeze or worse.  We will not tolerate spammers.
 
6. $B$3Bugs$R - Using ANY bug to your advantage is illegal.  This includes anything
   from large bugs, to even the smallest minute bug.  Using a bug or even
   knowing about a bug without reporting it is illegal, and a zap-punishable
   offense.  Reporting bugs can earn you a reward, but do not expect it.  Do
   not assume something is a "feature", ask a god.  See $Bhelp BUG$R for more.
 
7. $B$3Ping-Pong$R - Repeatedly killing a player that has a CANTQUIT flag while
   they are otherwise passively waiting for the flag to wear off is illegal.
   In excess it is considered spam, and generally is a form of harassment.
   Do not abuse the particulars of our pkill system. See "$BHelp PINGPONG$R"
   for more information.
 
8. $B$3Home Rooms$R - Setting your home inside a god's room is illegal.  If caught
   you will be punished.
 
   Setting your home in, or exploiting, a safe room that is OUTSIDE of a town
   is not permitted.  At the moment there should not be any such rooms.  If
   you know of one you are expected to report it.  Failure to do so will be
   punished.  Inside of a town is considered anything within $BSorpigal, New
   Thalos, or Far Reach.$R  The only exceptions to this rule are the monk and
   ranger guilds, as well as the Skill Master's cabin in the forest west of
   town.  The helpfiles outline most of these issues.
 
   Setting home in clanhalls or guilds other than your own is not permitted
   and should not be possible.  Please report any variances immediately.
 
9. $B$3Censorship$R - On Dark Castle, you are free to say most whatever you want to
   whoever you want - with some logical exceptions.  Insulting an Immortal
   may result in whatever punishment the Immortal Staff wishes to exact.
   You do not need to show adulation for Immortals (though we don't mind),
   but you DO need to offer common respect.  Other forms of harassment are
   dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but use common sense -- if you don't
   have any, ask someone who does.
 
   The authority of all the Immortal Staff is to be respected.  If you make a
   request to an Immortal to overturn a legal issue and your request is
   refused, your only option is to appeal to a higher-level Immortal.  If you
   do not accept this and continue to press the issue, disciplinary action
   will likely ensue. "Playing" Immortals off each other is a good way to be
   punished or permanently ignored.
 
The idea behind these rules and guidelines is to enhance the enjoyment of all
the players of Dark Castle, not to make life miserable or difficult.  The 
Immortal Staff will do its best to enforce these in a fair, open, and
respectful manner and expects the same in return.
 
We strive very hard to make a game that is fun and relatively free from many
of the overbearing restrictions you may find on other games. Feel free to
contact any Immortal with ideas or feedback about DC.

E:
If you will be leaving Dark Castle for more than three weeks but plan on
returning thereafter, please use the archive command, which is available
at the login menu to archive any and all characters you do not want to
have deleted due to inactivity.

When you are archived, your character file will be compressed and placed
in an archive directory. Once you are archived, you will not be able to
play the character again until you have sent an email message asking to
be reactivated or asked a level 107 or higher online to unarchive the
character.

Archiving is also an attractive option for those players who feel the need
to limit their gaming time. Archiving your characters before finals week,
for example, is often a wise idea. It will require you to at least wait
until a high enough god is available to unarchive your character.

aliases to help players without access to a MUDding client.

Syntax:   alias <name of alias, no spaces> = <Single command to perform>
          Note: The '=' is important.

Example:  alias eb = eat bread

To remove an alias, you simply type alias followed by
the name of the alias, with no additional arguments.

Syntax:   alias <Name of alias to remove>
Example:  alias eb

SUBMIT SOCIAL, HELP, EMOTE, WWW
L: 1
E:
Socials are commands for displaying emotion or action to another
player in the game.  The message is tailored to who in the room
receives it.  For example:  lick.  If the character Pirahna licked
the character Sabranth, Sabranth would see 'Pirahna licks you.'
Pirahna would see 'You lick him.' and everyone else in the room
would see 'Pirahna licks Sabranth.'

Typing "social" will give you a listing of all the socials currently
in the game.

If you would like to submit an idea for a social, please read the
'help submit social' helpfile, and follow the instructions therein.

ARENA
ARENA RULES
NONE
NONE
NONE
BROWNIE, QUEST, PRIZE ARENA, POTATO ARENA, ARENA COMMAND
L: 1
E:
Arenas are opportunities given you by the gods to show your prowess in
battle.  The object is to kill everyone else and be the last person
standing.   The last person standing may get a prize.  The prize
ranges from the joy of winning to money or possibly a brownie point
given by the god overseeing the arena.

It is not possible to inflict any harm to other combatants until the
arena gates have been closed.  Also, you will find it impossible to
steal.  Recalling from an arena is not an option, and teleport merely
sends you to another room in the chaos.

If an arena is opened with no statement of the host, assume that no
rules have been decreed.  Some immortals may demand that you not
"group", which also extends to not following friends or stalking prey.
Client aids which allow you to "follow" an enemy without actually
using the command are acceptable in this case.  Generally, Clan Chaos
is the only arena with rules (ask the sponsoring immortal for further
clarification).

Side note: gossiping or praying for arenas is generally not the most
effective way to persuade the gods to run one.
 
Immortal note: The admin helpfile for this command is listed as "ARENA COMMAND".

ARBITRATION
ARBITRATOR
NONE
HELP, PASSWORD, RULES
L: 1
E:
Do *not* pray for arbitrations.  You will be ignored, most likely, if not
silenced if you abuse the channel in this fashion.

A player may ask an immortal to assist in the completion of a sale of an
item or character.  They are under no obligation to assist you, but if
you're nice and patient enough, most visible ones will.  Like most
transactions with immortals, it is best to start with the lowest level
ones first, and work up from there.

Upon request, an immortal arbitrator may verify that the deal is correct
(i.e. checking the goods to see if the seller is lying), but they are also
under no obligation to offer this service.  The arbitrator may NOT give
out statistics, simply nod or shake their head on the deal.

Have your transaction ready before you consult an immortal for an arb.  It
is annoying for them to take time out to assist unprepared mortals with
unclear information on a sale.  This means convert platinum beforehand.

Arbitrations will only be conducted with gold, equipment, or, in the case
of trades, characters.  We cannot and will not be responsible for any
transaction involving real cash.

Special Note: Do NOT give the arbitrating immortal your password!!!
There is no need for this!  The buyer gives the payment for the immortal
to handle, and the seller gives the buyer the goods/password.  Once the
password is changed, then the immortal gives the seller the payment.

RESTRING
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
HELP, IMMORTAL
L: 1
E:
Upper level gods possess the mystic power of restringing, which is
changing the name or appearance, but not the nature of items.  If
you want to ask a god to restring your items, you're welcome to, but
be aware that they are under absolutely no obligation to do so.  
 
Do NOT pester gods for restrings.  This will only result in an
incredibly cranky god and no restring.  Do not pray for restrings.
 
In addition, you may not have a restring that...
 
- Resembles the loaded descriptions of game/quest/godload
- Is a deliberate attempt to imitate or mimic an item for the
  purposes of fakeselling or other similar deception.
- Affects a quest (questload) item in any way
- Does not have an exact matching noun in both keyword and short
  descriptions (i.e. no "keyword "gold" or "the" stuff)
- Resembles a corpse
- Resembles an immortal token or other special immortal item
- Is just numbers, random letters, or symbols with no words
- Is racist, slandering, or excessively offensive
 
Honestly, folks, restrings are meant to make the game more creative
and personalized.  They're not here to prevent pthieves from having
any fun, to carry out your hateful agendas, or make fake-selling a
whole lot easier.  Like anything else, this is a privilege that can
be restricted or taken away.
 
If you wish a restring, it will cost you $BONE Immortal Token$R.
Read $BHELP TOKEN$R for more details on this.
 
$B$4Attention Immortals:$R Read "help STRING COMMAND" before peforming
ANY restrings for ANY reason.  It outlines the details of what is permissable.

Brownie points are a game item which players may trade in to Phire, 
the quest master, in order to attempt group quests.  They can
be obtained during hunts or prize arenas as a reward.  Brownies
can be stolen, scrapped, and remain in corpses, so they should
be guarded well.

Clan Rewards Vouchers are special rewards you can receive as a part
of a team or clan related contest or activity run by an immortal.
These vouchers are redeemable for almost any costs associated with
a clan.  This includes: clan creation fees, clan hall costs, or
any fines, but not clan vault fees.
Each clan voucher is worth 250 platinum towards the listed costs.

When creating a new character, you can choose to be one of 9 races.
Based on the bonuses/penalties they get to their stats (listed in
each race's individual help file) some races are more suited to
particular classes than others.  For example, hobbits get a high
bonus to dex, making them excellent thieves.
 
Races vary in their respective sizes and thus much of the equipment
you will be able to wear will be dependant upon the size of your race.
 
Each race has a potential maximum of 125 skill points alotted in a
different manner for each race.  This information is also explained in
each race's individual help file.
 
Most races also get innate skills or abilities. The innate abilities
of your race can be viewed with the 'innate' command.

Dwarves are a shorter, stockier cousin of Humankind -- with a much

tall, with thick arms and legs, and wide backs.  Many Dwarves prefer
to live in rocky terrain: badlands, hills, and mountains -- as they
believe they draw their strength from the earth, as well as from their
beards.

A Hobbit, or Halfling, is a child-like Human in appearance, yet

have strangely-plump bellies, or excessively hairy shins and feet.
Nearly all Hobbits enjoy a good smoke, a big meal, and a good

shallow underground homes called burrows.
 
Hobbits are wily and very agile by nature -- though not all follow

$B$2Skills, Songs, and Spells Commands$R
 
There are 3 commands that will provide you with a complete output of 
all abilities within the game.  These are $BSPELLS$R, $BSKILLS$R,
and $BSONGS$R.  Entering any one of these will provide you with a
comprehensive list with requisites, costs, classes and levels.
 
$B$2General Information$R
 
Spells and skills (including songs) are the abilities that a particular
class or character has that set him or her apart from the others.
Most abilities are received from gaining experience and leveling.
The abilities you receive are dependant upon your $BCLASS$R.
 
Some skills are available to people through trainers and not every skill
can be learned by everyone.  It's up to you to discover what you can and
cannot learn.  Many skills also require a deed, payment, or action be
performed before they can be successfully learned.  These requirements
are called $BSKILL QUESTS$R.
 
Your knowledge of a skill is based on a scale out of 100.  The level to
which you have learned a skill will appear on your $BPRACTICE$R list as
a descriptor such as: "horrible", "bad", "good", "superb", etc.
 
Each skill, spell, or ability also has two $BREQUISITE$R attributes that
are associated with it.  Improving these stats will allow you very
slightly higher levels within the affiliated skill, but mostly the
higher stats will help increase the chances of improving spells or
skills when you use them.  ($Bsee help REQUISITES$R)

$B$2General Information$R
 
There are two primary factors that determine how high your character
can improve its various abilities.  These are: $BRACE$R and $BCLASS$R.
 
Each class has maximum levels to which it can learn its abilities and
these "caps" are further modified based upon the maximum levels to which
your race can $BMETA$R its $BATTRIBUTES$R.
 
As a general rule, abilities that belong $Bonly$R to your class can be
learned and improved to 100/100, whereas abilities that are shared with
another class can only be improved to a maximum of 90/100.
 
There are a variety of helpfiles that are outlining this ability improvement
system.  Some of these include: $BCONCENTRATION, IMPROVE, REQUISITE,
SKILLS, SKILL GROUPS, ATTRIBUTES$R.  They are worth reading.
 
$B$2The Ability Improvement System$R
 
Classes can learn their abilities to varying degrees. For example,
a warrior might be able to learn their kick skill to "good" or a maximum
of 80/100, whereas a monk might be able to learn this same skill to
"superb" or 90/100.
 
The following information outlines the details on how to improve your
skills to their available maximum.
 
$B1)$R The $B$3first 50%$R of your available skill knowledge (available meaning
whatever the "max" for your class is, be it 100, 80, 40, etc.) can be
gained via "practices" at your guild or simply by automatically advancing
the skill through repeated use (see $B"help IMPROVE"$R).
 
$B2)$R The $B$3next 25%$R of your available skill knowledge can only be gained
by advancing the skill through repeated use. (see $B"help IMPROVE"$R).
 
$B3)$R The $B$3final 25%$R of your available skill knowledge only becomes
available when you have "meta'ed" (see $B"help META"$R) the $BREQUISITE$R
attributes associated with the $BSKILL GROUP$R the ability is in.
 
Each skill has two requisite attributes associated with its potential
maximum.  For every point $B$3over 15$R that either of these attributes
are "meta'ed", 1% of this final 25% becomes available to you.

$B$2Examples$R
  
Here are some step-by-step examples:
 
$B$3Example 1:$R (maximum case scenario)
$BA Gnome learning a spell with a 100 cap and metaed max Int/Wis could....$R
1) Practice a skill that is in a "Int/Wis" group to 50
2) Improve through use this skill to 75
3) Max their Int (28) and Wis (30) allowing them +12 and +15 to their max
      (hence, a potential max of 102...but capped at 100)
 
$B$3Example 2:$R (demonstrating human 95 skill cap)
$BA Human learning a spell with a 100 cap and metaed max Con/Dex could....$R
1) Practice a skill that is in an "Con/Dex" group to 50
2) Improve through use this skill to 75
3) Max their Con (25) and Dex (25) allowing them +10 and +10 to their max
    (hence, a potential max of 95)
 
$B$3Example 3:$R (worst case scenario)
$BA Pixie learning a spell with a 100 cap and metaed max Str/Con could....$R
1) Practice a skill that is in a "Str/Con" group to 50
2) Improve through use this skill to 75
3) Max their Str (20) and Con (20) allowing them +5 and +5 to their max
    (hence, a potential max of 85 in this skill)
 
$B$3Example 4:$R (a below 100 max scenario)
$BA Human learning a spell with a 80 cap and metaed max Str/Dex could....$R
1) Practice this skill that is in an "Str/Dex" group to 40 (50% of the 80 max)
2) Improve through use this skill to 60 (the next 25% of the 80 max)
3) Meta Con (25) and Dex (25) giving +10% and +10% (8 points each) to their max
    (hence, a potential max of 76 in this skill)
 
If the above information doesn't make sense to you, feel free to ask a
member of the Immortal Team ($Bhelp EMAIL$R) for clarification.
Or just enjoy laying down beatings with your character!
 
      $B$2Hint:$R Each class has $BSKILL GROUPS$R associated with each attribute,
            and some classes have more than one skill group associated
            with an attribute.  As a result, we highly reccomend improving
            as many of your attributes as possible.

Tame allows the skilled ranger to calm a wild beast in such a way that it
is completely loyal to the ranger.  This is similar to the traditional
"charm" spell, but is much more effective for natural beasts.

The number of "tamed" creatures a ranger can control is based upon
the ranger's level.  The success of tame is based upon how well the
ranger knows the tame skill.

A ranger receives: $Blevel/5$R "slots" for taming mobs.
Mobs use up slots in the following manner:

Level 50 mob - $B10 slots$R
Level 41-49  - $B7 slots$R
Level 31-40  - $B5 slots$R
Level 21-30  - $B3 slots$R
Level 11-20  - $B2 slots$R
Level  1-10  - $B1 slot$R

Note: The MOST tamed mobs a ranger can command at once, regardless
      of "slots" open is 3.

Because the creatures tamed by rangers are generally "animal" in
nature, they are restricted in what kinds of items they can wear.

RKILL, RDEATH, STAT LOSS, PERM DEATH
L: 1
E:
$BPkilling:$R
   Pkilling is legal. The defeated player loses NOTHING, and does
   not leave a corpse (Unless the player is flagged thief - See HELP
   RULES)
 
$BDeath by Monster:$R
   If you are killed in normal battle, you will lose some experience;
   possibly as much as half of your current experience before the death.
   (depending on your level--higher levels lose more)
   If you are level 20 or higher, you have a chance of losing one
   attribute point.  If you are level 50, you have an additional small
   chance of losing a second attribute point. (Ouch!)
 
$BPthief Death:$R
   If you are flagged pthief and killed by a fellow clanmember or commit
   suicide, it will count as being killed by a monster.  Pthieves always
   leave corpses when killed and lose half their experience, no matter
   what.  Also, a pthief has a chance of random stat loss if they are
   killed by a player, but they are guaranteed stat loss if they are killed
   by a mobile.
 
$BDeath at Level 50:$R
   At level 50, there are two important changes to how "real deaths" can
   affect your character.  These are outlined in "$BHELP RKILL$R".
 
   $BNOTE:$R Player characters under level 10 do not leave a corpse when 
         they are killed by a mobile. Likewise, you may not consent anyone 
         under level 10 to loot your corpse.
 
$B$4VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:$R If any stat drops below 5, your character will be
                     permanently deleted.

OEDIT CONTAINER
CONTAINER
CONTAINER LIDS
LID
LIDS
OEDIT, STAT, OPEDIT, OPSTAT
L: 103
E:
The following codes set the containers state (open, closed, locked, etc) when used
in the v2 slot during item creation of a container:
 
0 = no lid (always open)
1 = lockable (loads with a lockable lid, but in the open state)
2 = not pickable (when locked, the lid is not lock-pickable)
4 = closed (loads with a lid in the closed state)
8 = locked (if a lid is present, it loads locked)
 
Combinations of these options will determine the state of your container.

For example: a closed, locked, and unpickable container would have a v2 of 15
             1 (lockackable) + 2 (!pick) + 4 (closed) + 8 (locked) = v2 of 15
 
Note: the v1 slot on a key item will determine what container they open.

CHANNEL, SOCIAL
L: 1
E:
Ignore will allow you to ignore one or more persons whose name you

NONE
NONE
CHANNELS, RULES, IMMORTAL, WIZLIST, EMAIL
L: 1
E:
Pray will allow you to send a message to any and all gods that are on.
Note that if you spam them, there are consequences.   Know also that
any god can choose to ignore all or select prayers.  Be wise in
choosing when to pray.

It's better to see if any gods are visible and tell then
what you need assistance with first, before praying. In addition
most of the implementer level gods request that you seek assistance
with a lower level god prior to asking them.

Keep in mind that spamming the pray channel is a good way to get zapped.
Also keep in mind that you are MUCH more likely to receive a response
if you state your business or problem rather than just a random
"are there any imms up there" pray.

you can only be "sensed" by the "sense life" spell affecting a mob/player.
Even if sensed your identity will remain hidden.  Hide is broken by
typing a command that others could see, such as say, but you will not be
notified when you are no longer hiding.

Example:

  > hide
  You attempt to hide yourself.
  >  (you wait for ex. 5 mins and remain hidden for 5 mins)
  >  say hello
     (The "say" breaks your hide}

                                you can type 'leave')

  THIEF ONLY: look at <mob/pc> <opened container in inventory>
  (Note: thieves automatically have the traditional "peek" ability
          as a part of their skill set and are the only class that
          can view another's inventory or inside other's objects.)

A person with "anonymous" turned on will not display class/level info.
 
There are several arguments you can give 'who' to isolate particular
things you are looking for:
 
<name>               - lists all people who have a name equal
                       to or begining with specified name

TOGGLE, WHO, LEVELS, CLASSES, COUNT
L: 1
E:
This function, applied through toggle, will hide your class and level
from the prying eyes of the other players on Dark Castle.  The advantage
of it is people won't know what to expect of you, but the disadvantage
is the same. Anonymous players will only list percentages instead of actual
stats when using the 'report' and 'group' commands.
#

TITLE, WHO, RENAME, TARGET
L: 1
E:
You can change the name that other players see, using this command.
You are not able to use this command until level 5, and if you
put something offensive in your name, a god will take away your ability to
change it.

If your name is Morcallen:
>name Mr. %
would change your name to 'Mr. Morcallen.'

For those of you who wish to change your mud birth given name entirely
see RENAME for the procedure and cost.

Syntax:   name <string>. Where string is a string that includes your real
          name.
          "%" is used to indicate where the real name should be.

You can also "give all.keyword" to a target or "give all" to a target.
 
Example:  give all Smurf  (would give all the items in your inventory to Smurf)
          give all.fish Gargamel (would give all items with the keyword
                                  "fish" to Gargamel.)

L: 1
E:
If you want to wear some clothes, armor or the likes.  Note that if the
item is class restrictive, you will receive the message 'You are
forbidden' while trying to wear it.  If you are a monk, and the item is
more than a monk's allowed amount of AC, then you will be told that 'You
cannot wear such restrictive armor.'  Each piece of equipment is only
wearable by characters of specific sizes. If you try to wear an item of
the wrong size you will be told that the item 'does not fit'. Lastly, if
the item is anti your alignment, than you will try to wear the item, but
it will 'zap' you, and fall to the ground.

For example:  wear boots
              wear backpack about
              wear all

NONE
NONE

REMOVE, EQUIPMENT, STRENGTH, SWITCH, TWO HANDERS
L: 1
E:
When you get tired of whacking monsters with your fists, you might consider
wielding a weapon. Example : wield sword
 
Weapons require the player to have a minimum strength in order to wield.
Your primary wield can weigh as much as your str, natural or modified,
up to your racial maximum.  Your secondary wield can weigh as much as
50% of the primary wield amount.
 
For example, a troll (28 racial max str) with a current strength of 18
could wear a primary weapon up to 18 pounds and a secondary weapon up
to 9 pounds.

A troll affected by the "strength" spell who's str was raised to 28
as a result, could wear a primary weapon up to 28 pounds and a
secondary weapon up to 14 pounds.  However, a troll who was affected
by a spell that raised their str to 30 could STILL only wield a 
primary weapon up to 28 pounds (the troll racial max).
 
You may also specify "wield <weapon> primary" which will wield the
selected weapon in your primary hand, automatically shifting your current
primary wield to your off-hand.  Should the shifted wield be too heavy to
off-hand, it will automatically move into your inventory.

What is Trivia?
 
1)  Trivia is a channel over which trivia games are conducted.
An immortal asks the questions, and mortals answer over the same
channel.  (Use:  trivia <message text><enter>)
 
2)  Trivia is a game and means of earning brownie points and other
prizes (such as gameload and gold).  Trivias are run both on a
scheduled basis and also occasionally impromptu.
 
When are trivias held?
 
Whenever an immortal, of the appropriate level, schedules one.
 
What are the rules of Trivia?
 
1) Be courteous to and considerate of the immortal hosting the
trivia.  He/she has put some time and effort into preparing a trivia,
and also into running it.  Your way of thanking and rewarding an
immortal for the opportunity to compete in trivias for prizes should
be to follow a few simple rules and to treat the host(ess) with
the utmost courtesy.
 
2) Inappropriate commentary should be kept off of the trivia channel
during an official trivia.  Any complaints about specific questions
should be directed toward the host(ess) at the end of the game,
before the final score tabulation and prize distribution.  The
host(ess) is, however, the final judge of the correct answer of a
question, and his/her authority should be respected.  Additional
commentary directed at other players and/or oneself should be
directed toward another, more appropriate channel.
 
Failure to comply with these simple rules, as well as any others
specifically stipulated by the hosting immortal will result in
disciplinary action.  Anyone who interferes with the progress of
a trivia or otherwise makes themselves a nuisance during a trivia
will be warned first, booted without warning on the second offence,
and silenced for the duration of trivia if he/shes continues to
engage in disruptive behavior.  Repeatedly disruptive behavior may
result in an individual being temporarily or permanently banned
from competing in trivia games.
 
Questions, comments, complaints, and/or suggestions about trivias
should be directed to Apocalypse, whose email address can be found
in "help email"

CONCENTRATION

SKILL SUCCESS
NONE
NONE
INT, WIS, CAST, META, SKILLS, LEARN, REQUISITES, FIZZLE
L: 1
E:
$B$2General Information$R
 
Often, though you try your best, your skill, spell, or ability
just plain old screws up.  When a spell caster loses his or her
concentration, the spell fails and half the mana cost of the
spell is lost. This also applies to skills and abilities with
costs of movement, ki, or hit points.
 
$B$2Basic Success Rates$R
 
Your $Bbase % chance$R of success on any ability is approximately 50%.
This means if you have improved a skill beyond the "not learned"
stage, you have a $Bminimum 50% chance$R of success.  For each skill
point (out of 100) you advance above the first, your chance of 
success improves accordingly.
 
Note 1: all non-human races have a $Bminimum 3% chance of failure$R and
humans a 5% chance of failure no matter how well they have learned.
(Even if a skill is at the "100" skill level.)
 
Note 2: any skill that cannot be learned to 100 by your character
has a maximum concentration of $Bskill_level_% + attribute_bonus$R.
For example, if you can only learn "curse" to 70, the chance of a
successful casting is 70% + attribute_bonus.
 
$B$2Additional Modifiers$R
 
Some abilities have other stats that can affect their success rates.
This includes wisdom or intelligence for various classes as listed
in the $BINT$R and $BWIS$R helpfiles.
 
A specific example of these other modifiers is the backstab skill.
Backstab's success is directly correlated to the attacker's and
defender's dexterity (DEX) and target's armour class (AC).
 
$B$2The Formula$R
 
For those who are interested (and to save the Imm staff from hearing
endless questions about how it works), here is the exact formula
employed by the concentration code:
 
     $B$350 + skill_level/1.5 + int_or_wis_bonus + skill_specific_modifiers
                           $R(for spells/ki)        (for skills)
 
This formula is also subject to the constraints of:
 
     $BMax success for non-humans:$3 97% or skill_level + modifiers
       $R(whichever is lower)
     $BMax success for humans:$3 95% or skill_level + modifiers
       $R(whichever is lower)
 
$BNote:$R the INT/WIS bonus and skill specific modifiers are only
      included where applicable.
 
$B$2Re-Casting After a Failure$R
 
When concentration is lost casting a particular spell, the subsequent
re-casting of the same spell within the same regen pulse takes place at
a much higher rate of success (as obviously, you're taking extra care
to avoid making a mistake the second time around).
 
The chance of failure when casting the same spell immediately after a
loss of concentration is:
 
     $B$3 1% + special_modifiers$R
        (special_modifiers indicates skills that target concentration rates.)

The best way to obtain this wonderful resource is to
slay mobs and relieve them of their stash.
 
Gold can be converted to platinum at the Meta Shop in Sorpigal
at the rate of 20,000 gold to 1 Platinum.
 
In order to safely store your gold without having to change
it into platinum, we suggest using the Sorpial Bank.
 
$BNote:$R If your total gold is more than 4 billion you run the
risk of having it reset to 0, which it does once reaching a

in the bank can not be stolen or lost when you die.  In an effort to
expand its monetary services, the Bank of Sorpigal now provides an
account for every clan as well.

You must be at the bank in order to use the following commands:

The following commands allow you to access your bank account.
withdraw <amount> - transfer gold from your bank account to your character
deposit <amount>  - transfer gold from your character to your bank account
balance           - tells you how much gold you have in your bank account

The following commands allow you to access your clans' bank account.
cwithdraw <amount> - transfer gold from your clans' bank account to your
                     character (assuming you have the right to do so)
cdeposit <amount>  - transfer gold from your character to your clans'
                     bank account

NONE
SKILLS, STRENGTH, CLASSES
L: 1
E:
To bash someone is to attempt to 'knock' that person over. If you 
succeed, you will inflict minor damage, and cause the victim to 
fall on their rear. The victim will be unable to issue any commands 
for 2 rounds of violence.  If you miss you lose your balance and fall,
you will not be able to type any commands for 2 rounds of violence
whether you hit or miss the bash.
 
To successfully bash someone, you must be wielding a weapon.  However,
the actual hit itself is done with your off-hand.  For this reason, it
is much easier to bash someone while using a shield.  Two-handed weapons
also are more effective than using single-handed weapons though not to
the degree of a shield.

The success of a bash depends on what you are wielding/holding as
well as a few other modifiers.  How well you are learned in the skill
provides your basic chance to land a bash.  The class of your victim
also has an impact as a combat veteran is much more likely to
avoid being bashed, as well as your strength compared to your victim's.

essence, you hit your opponent right in the stomach, causing them to be
motionless for close to two rounds.  This is of great advantage against

Use steal to steal items from people. The chance of not getting caught 
depends on how well you have practiced steal and if the person is asleep.
There is a chance that when stealing from a sleeping person they may wake 
up when their item is un-equipped but before it is stolen.
 
You gain exp if you succeed in stealing from a mob that's not asleep or
incapacitated (paralyzed).  Your chances of pulling off a succesful heist
are based upon a combination of: your +TO_HIT, your skill level in steal,
and the weight of the item you are attempting to pilfer.
 
Stealing from a player character has special consequences.
See $B'help PSTEAL'$R for more information.
 
Syntax:   steal <item> <target>
 
A thief may also attempt to steal from a victim's inventory of gold via the
$BPOCKET$R command.  Use of this command to pocket from a player character
also has special consequences (though different from "steal") which are

There are two types of "THIEF" flags on Dark Castle:
  $BDIRTY_THIEF$R and $BGOLD_THIEF$R
 
The information below outlines the details and differences between the two.
 
  $BDIRTY_THIEF$R
If you choose to use the $B$4steal skill$R against a player OR $BLOOT$R an
item from a player's corpse resulting from an "$BRKILL$R", you will be flagged
with a DIRTY_THIEF flag. As long as you have this flag, you will be unable
to give, donate, sell, or otherwise transfer ANY of your carried items
to another player or mob. In addition, you will be unable to enter a
guild or chall of any kind.
 
If you die to a mob or a player while you have a DIRTY_THIEF flag, you will 
lose a random stat regardless of level, and you will leave a corpse that 
$Banybody$R can loot.
 
NEWBIE flagged items cannot be stolen from players.
 
NO_TRADE items CAN be stolen from players, but the item will disappear and
neither the thief nor the victim will keep the item once it *poofs*.
 
  $BGOLD_THIEF$R
If you choose to use the $B$5pocket ability$R against a player OR $BLOOT$R
the coins from a player's corpse resulting from an "$BRKILL$R", you will be
flagged with a GOLD_THIEF flag. As long as you have this flag you will be
unable to give, drop, deposit, or otherwise perform any transaction involving
ANY gold coins.  In addition, you will be unable to enter a guild or chall
of any kind.
 
If you die to a mob or player while you have the GOLD_THIEF flag, you will
suffer a "$BPDEATH$R" and all your inventory gold will fall to the ground
in the room in which you were killed.  Note that you do NOT lose items
and do NOT leave a corpse in this instance.
 
$B$3Note 1:$R When flagged with either of these two flags you will be unable
to use the "RECALL" (see $Bhelp RECALL$R) command.  As well, a person
with either of these flags will not be able to be targetted with $Bsummon$R.
 
$B$3Note 2:$R When flagged with the DIRTY_THIEF flag (but not the GOLD_THIEF
flag) you will be unable to use (or cast/quaff/etc) any of the following:
Word of Recall, Group Recall, Astral Chanty, Portal, Teleport, and Beacon.
 
$B$3Note 3:$R Helpfiles for $BDEATH$R, $BRKILL$R, $BLOOT$R, $BPOCKET$R, and $BSTEAL$R all outline
further details about these flags that are important to understand.

E:
A backstab is when an attacker launches a stealthy attempt to place a 
dagger in a victim's back at exactly the point where it will deal the 
most damage. A successful backstab delivers tremendous damage based 
upon the level of the attacker.

To use this skill you must be wielding a weapon which pierces or stings.
 
The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well you
have practiced backstab at your guild. You can always backstab sleeping
persons.

miss, your opponent will be able to attack one extra round.  A cursed
weapon cannot be disarmed, but on the other hand cannot be unwielded
either.

A character without a weapon will do less damage and will be unable to
parry. A disarmed player may find their weapon in the hands of a thief if
they are not careful.  (Or more likely, if your weapon is in the hands of
a thief, you probably wont find it at all.)

HIDE, SNEAK, SKILLS
L: 1
E:
Stalk allows you to follow someone completely unnoticed. This is done
through a combination of hide and sneak. No message is given to your
victim that you are following them. The success of this depends on how
well you've practiced.

Syntax:   stalk <target>

NONE

BACKSTAB, SKILLS, DUALBACKSTAB
L: 1
E:
Theives are neither particularly known for honesty or sense
of fair play.  These traits extend to combat where they have
developed a "unique" set of skills that are not widely
regarded as "honourable".
 
The circle skill allows a thief to stealthily disengage from
their opponent and circle behind them to attack from the rear.
The thief will be unable to type any command for 2 rounds of
combat after each circle attack.
 
If the thief is the tank (see $RHELP TANK$R), a circle cannot
be performed save one exception: if the thief is only engaged
in combat with a single target that has been dazed via the
$BJAB$R skill, a circle may be attempted.
 
Circling with barehands or a non-stabbing wield will result in
a pair of extra, slightly-enhanced standard attacks.  A circle
attempt with one or more stabbing weapons wielded will result
in a potentially lethal backstab attempt.
 
Note that backstabs delivered via circle are not as damaging as
a normal backstab.  Circle can only be performed in combat, and
cannot be used to initate combat.

can't wield or hold a weapon to use it.

At higher skill levels, the monk also has a small chance to instantly
slay the victim of an eagleclaw!

Casting is the means by which mages, clerics, and a few other classes
can use their spells.

Syntax:   cast '<spell name>' [character].

Example:  cast 'burning hands' enfan

This will cast the spell known as Burning Hands at the pc or npc named
enfan.  Note that the name of the spell must be enclosed by the holy
magic symbols which are similar in appearance to an apostrophe ( ' ).

Also note that if the spell is a directed, aggressive spell, and no
target is supplied, it will target the person (mob, pc) you are fighting
automatically.

Some items however may not be dropped.  These items are known as cursed
items.  In order to get rid of these, you must find a helpful cleric
or a shop keeper who might even pay you for these cursed items.

survive the perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade
only in a specific type of merchandise. The following commands may be
used at a shop: buy, sell, list, and value.

Note: To how the commands mentioned above function, please reference
      their associated helpfiles.

While there are shops scattered throughout the realms of Dark Castle,
the city of Sorpigal is home to several retailers.

L: 1
E:
Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills.  You must go to
your guildmaster to practice.  With no argument, PRACTICE lists your
current skills.  With an argument, PRACTICE will practice that spell, skill
or song.  You will get practices every time you level.  The higher wisdom
you have, the more practices you will get. The higher intelligence you
have, the more skill you will gain from each practice. Many skills are
shared by more than one class, but some classes are able to practice these
skills up to a higher ability than others. For example, a warrior has the
potential to become much more proficient at the 'shield block' skill than
a thief ever could, even though both classes posses this skill.

Syntax:   practice
          practice <skill|spell|song>

Each skill can be learned to a different level out of 100.

NONE
EMAIL, WIZLIST, IMMORTAL
L: 1
E:
So, you think you have an idea that might make DC more enjoyable, or
better overall?  Well, read this before doing anything--to make sure
that your idea has merit.

Most of the ideas we get are actually just complaints.  Think about
what you're saying.  Is it just a criticism that doesn't suggest any
sort of alternative or addition?  This sort of "idea" doesn't help
anyone out, and we ignore them.  In other words, save your breath.

The next batch of ideas we get are pretty unbalancing or are just
changes to existing features to make them more powerful.  Consider
the scope of what your idea may do to the MUD: if we gave fireshield
to more classes or increased the chance to bingo.  Besides being
unoriginal, we've probably heard all these "ideas" before.

Some ideas we get would require a lot of change to the MUD's code,
especially some of the more critical files.  Certain changes even
require us to do a pfile wipe (how's that for extreme?).  Most people
have no coding experience, so it's hard for them to ascertain the
level of work their ideas would require.  If it sounds like it would
be a lot of effort and modification, it probably will be.

Finally, we occasionally get ideas that are original and practical,
and don't take too much skin off our backs to implement.  It's a
win-win situation.

If you think your idea is original, practical, and not very demanding--
email it to a world imp or a code imp, depending on the type of idea
it is.  Think it all out first, and try to find all the loopholes and

L: 1
E:
If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get' to pick
it up. Example: "get greatsword". If you are in a hurry, or if you just
feel very greedy, you may type "get all". You can also use 'get' to
extract objects from containers. Example: "get dagger bag",
"get all corpse".

NO TRADE items can not be picked up, or removed from a container in
conjunction with the 'get all' or 'get all.[item keyword]' commands. They
can still be gotten, however, but only individually.

L: 1
E:
Dark Castle has a suggestion board located west of the Albatross Tavern
in Sorpigal.  You are encouraged to leave your suggestions and complaints
there.

>look board

This command lists the messages on the board in the order they were
written. The listing shows the message number, date it was written, title
and author.

>read <number>        To read a particular message, use this command.
>read                 To read the next message after the one you just read.

>write <title>

In order to write a note, you will need to be in the same room as
the board, and you must be at least level 5.

Use "write <title>"  to start writing your message. When you are done
type /s on a new line. This will take you out of the message editor. 

>erase <number>       To erase a message that is no longer relevent,
                      or to erase the message you just wrote when you
                      realize you could write it so much better.
                      Mortals of the realm may only erase their own posts.

It's a very good idea to check it out once in a while.
If you have trouble getting the proper response when typing "news".
your client may be interpreting news as North,East,West,South... and
sending the direction commands to the mud.  For your convienence, we
have enabled you to type thenews instead, which wont be interpreted as
a speedwalk, because T and H are not abbreviations for directions.

I you would like to view the news in such a fashion as to have the
most recent entry at the bottom simply type "togg news-up" to reverse
its display order.

Note: Just using "news" or "thenews" will show the last 10 days news.
Using the "news all" or "thenews all" will show a full worklog.

L: 1
E:
For changing your position. If you feel weary, it's probably a good idea
to sit and rest for awhile; or maybe even take a nap. Resting
regenerates hit points, mana and moves at a faster rate than standing.
Sleeping is even better.  Beware - when sleeping, you can be stolen from

NONE
NONE
NONE
IMMORTAL, DEATH, MULTIPLAYING
L: 1
E:
Reimbursements are generally not given. That's why we have a Morgue with
an Undertaker. It is located above the Chamber of Charity.  Also know that
we are not in any way responsible for lost eq during transfers, and will
not reimb for it. Reimbs are RARELY given for equipment/stat loss due to a
crash, so please do not ask or pray for a reimb unless you feel that you
have an *exceptional* case to make before the immorts.

If you lost stats or equipment due to a bug, then you may be entitled to a
reimbursement. i.e. your strength has dropped to 0 without equipment, or
your player file has become corrupted.

Gather as much evidence as you can to support your case.  Remember the
conditions and time, capture screen logs, whatever you can.  If you
supply vague information, your plea is likely to be disregarded.

POLICY: You will receive what you can wear at your level and 3 items
        in your inventory.  Items that you cannot otherwise get your-
        self will not be reimbed until you talk to a Greater God, Overseer
        or Implementor.  Items which no longer load in the game will *not*
        be reimbursed (i.e. pre-revised equipment) for the simple reason
        that they no longer exist in that format.

IMPORTANT: Please do not pester immortals for reimbursements.

Spamming, as it is commonly known, is the act of repeating the same thing
over and over again, so as to either deliberately or accidentally cause
other players to see it again and again.  This becomes quite annoying,

score, you will find the total amount they will regen per pulse.  Certain
pieces of equipment may modify your regeneration rates in an either
positive or negative way.  Also, being hungry and/or thirsty will

SPELLS, DARKNESS
L: 1
E:
While not as effective as a lantern this spell lets the target see
in the dark by converting infrared energy given off by living creatures
and turning it into visible light. An inexperienced adventurer may
first dismiss this spell as inferior to a lantern, forgetting that
light created by the lantern also advertises their location to
monsters of the dark who may not take kindly to visitors.

Through the use of powerful magics and/or sheer force of will, mages and monks
have discovered a way of speeding up their body's natural range of motion and
speed in order to provide themselves with a combative advantage.

When under the influence of this dweomer or focus of will, the user will find
they often receive an additional strike during combat due to their increased
speed.  Some rare items about the world also possess the ability to imbue others
with this powerful incantation.

This powerful spell is only at the disposal of the most unholy (evil alignment) of warriors
and priests.  An attempt by a person of good intent (alignment) to use this incantation
will result in damage to themselves rather than their intended target.
 
Through this magic, the caster is able to cause a person of good intent to shiver and
suffer terribly for their kind ways.  The more noble the intended victim, the greater
the damage they receive.

IMMORTALS
WIZLIST, PRAY, EMAIL, IMPERSONATE, PASSWORD, CONTRIBUTE
L: 1
E:
The Implementors are listed on the top of the wizlist (type wizlist).
This mud is based on MERC Diku code, modified extensively by the
implementors.

If you have a problem with the game, see if an immortal is available
and ask them for help.  In general, start with the lowest level visible
immortal and work your way up.  If no one is available use pray,
but prays such as 'Is so-and-so on' are frowned upon.

If an implementor or an immortal asks you to do something, then do it.
If they ask you how something happened, then tell them.  As a player in
our mud, you are a guest at the party we are throwing.  If you hassle us,
we'll kick you out.

On the other side ... if an immortal interferes with game balance, or uses
immortal power to harass players, we (the implementors) will demote as
needed.  An immortal is not a superman mortal.  They are there to help
run the game, not for their own personal enjoyment.

Asking immortals for specific information about equipment, areas,
and other players is illegal.  Examples include but are not limited
to asking for a player's ip address, asking for the stats on a darked
item, or asking for the location of a hidden door.

On one hand, the immortal staff is here to answer any questions you
have about the game, but there is a line to be drawn between asking
when the clan chaos season starts and asking someone's exact stats.

The implementors, and immortals, may also have mortal characters.  Feel
free to treat these as you would any other players.

of a guildmaster.

Syntax:   gain

$BNote:$R Gaining from levels 1 through 50 is as described above.
However, to gain from level 50 to 51 you must have completed and earned

This command will provide a comparison between the monster and you.
The command gives information about the monsters armor and the damage it
inflicts. It also gives a comparison of its hit points and level to your
hit points and level respectively. The information consider provides are
a rough estimate, which is by no means exact.

Example:

GROUP, DEATH, LEVELS, GAIN, CONVERT
L: 1
E:
Whenever you kill a mob, you will receive experience points.  The harder
the mob, generally the more exps points you get.  When you receive enough
exps points, you have the ability to gain a level by visiting your guild.
Thieves also earn XP for stealing objects and coins.  You will lose XP by
dying by a mob.  Note that there is a max amount of exps that you can get
at one time called an XP cap.

$BThis is determined by your level multiplied by 8000.$R
 
For example, if you are level 10, you may only get 80000 exps with
one kill, even if the mob is worth 100000.

XP EXPERIENCE, DISBAND, PROMOTE, FOUND, SOLO
L: 1
E:
If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for
killing monsters.  Experience points will only be shared among group
members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing blow.
Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been participating
in the fight.  Also, you will not receive XP while grouped with a person
21 or more levels above you. In addition, XP is divided according to
level, ie, a higher level gets a larger percentage of the experience than
a lower level in the same group.
 
Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped,
and their current status.  Group <player> will add that player to the
group if you are the leader of a group.  Using group <player> again, on
the same player will remove that player from the group.

If you are in a group and one of your members is hidden, they will not
be obscured from your sight but will instead appear with a (hidden) flag
next to their name.  As well, you will see any members of your group as
they sneak in or out of the room.

WAND

L: 1
E:
Using a staff will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, except yourself in some situations. Therefore staves are naturally
very powerful, and yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target (even if you are
already in mid-battle), which can be either a character or an object.

Both stave's and wand's must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the
grab or hold commands).  You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion when actually using it.

Many objects behave like wands or staves without looking like them.
For instance, check out the vandal's spray can!

anything.  A successful check in the "blindfighting" skill will reduce
the AC and hit-roll penalty by half, though the player will still be

Note: There is also a small chance that some members of the group could

L: 103
E:
This command checks all the in-game zonefiles for mob loading rates or volumes
that fall outside the max-in-world parameters each mob loading line sets.
 
For Example:
 
If there are 10 lines that each load 1 guard, but a "max in world" set to 9
in one or more of those lines, a "MORE resets than max in world" message will
show.  This indicates either some of the extra mob loads need to be removed, the
max in world number adjusted to match the number of mob loading lines.
 
Conversely, if there are 10 lines that each load 1 guard, but a max in world set
to 11 in one or more of those lines, a "LESS resets than max in world" message will
appear.  This indicates additional mob loads need to be added or the max in world
number adjusted to match the number of mob loading lines. If you want to keep the
functionality of mobs popping on separate repops, put the new reset right after
the old one and flag it LsMbFl.

paralyzed. Victims more than 20 levels below the caster are unaffected
and the caster has a chance to be paralyzed.
 
It is more difficult to paralyze a person who is under the effects of
a sleep spell.  It is impossible to disarm a person who is paralyzed as
their fingers are magically frozen in place.

PROTECTION FROM EVIL

SPELLS, PFG, ALIGNMENT
L: 1
E:
PROTECTION FROM EVIL is a form of magical protection available primarily to
those in tune with the many holy or unholy energies throughout the world.

PROTECTION FROM EVIL or "PFE" will grant the caster protection from those creatures
who are of "Evil" alignment and aggressive towards one or more specific alignments.
(This means if a creature is any combination of "Aggressive Good, Evil, or Neutral"
will NOT "aggro" a player who has a sufficiently skillful protection cast upon them.)

NOTE: It is the skill level of the caster which determines the maximum level
      of creature that this incantation will guard against.

NOTE: PFE will always protect at least against mobs of your level or lower.

Those who are successfully under the protection of this spell will find they
are not "aggro'ed" by such mobs as outlined above.  NOTE however, that some
creatures throughout the realms are simply "aggressive" and will still attack
an unwary player regardless of the protections cast upon them.

Anti-Paladins, by virtue of their evil nature, are permanently affected by this
incantation at a level equal to that of their player level.  Anti-Paladins need
be wary however: should your "evil standing" slip into that of neutrality or outright
goodness, this innate protection will cease to aid you.

Only the holy magics of a cleric are powerful enough to CAST this spell upon
another player, though sometimes this protection can be acquired via items
throughout the world.

NOTE: A cleric casting this spell must be of good intent and not attempting to
combine its magic with that of "PROTECTION FROM GOOD" lest they disrupt each other.

Syntax:   cast 'protection from evil' [target]

his guts out for example!

Spanky, in addition to being one of the most amusing players ever, has

HOME, RECALL, SPELLS
L: 1
E:
This spell is used to magically transport the caster to whatever room
he or she has set as their "home."
 
The successful casting of this spell is dependant upon what manner of 
combat in which the caster is engaged.  When targetting a creature
(an NPC in PvM combat), Word of Recall may be used during combat as a 
means of escape.  However, when combating another of the gods' chosen 
(a PC in PvP combat), you must first flee combat in a cowardly fashion 
to use this means of escape.
 
Note for Clerics: The level that 'word of recall' is practiced to has
                  some bearing on the 'group recall' spell's efficacy

their charmies can use the portal. Cleric's version is open to whoever has
the courage to enter it.

Be warned that entering a portal, even one of your own making, can be
unexpectedly fatal. It is therefore prudent to use other magical implements

Damar Kindom has resulted in tenuous claims amongst the more nascent kingdoms
of the Diamond Isle.  Unfortunately the contention of ownership coupled with
the lack of a steward has led to the neglect of the roads through the forest
and allowed bandits to take refuge in the wooded hills of the Nysdawn.

NONE
SPELLS, DISPELL GOOD, PFE, PFG, ALIGNMENT
L: 1
E:
This powerful spell is only at the disposal of the most holy (good alignment) of warriors
and priests.  An attempt by a person of evil intent (alignment) to use this incantation
will result in damage to themselves rather than their intended target.

Through this magic, the caster is able to cause a person of evil intent to shiver and
suffer terribly for their cruel ways.  The more evil the intended victim, the greater
the damage they receive.

NONE
NONE
SPELLS, DISMISS FAMILIAR
L: 1
E:
It is well known that the more powerful wizards keep magical pets, known
as familiars. These familiars take on many roles of servitude to their
master, but the most prized familiar is the kind which can aid one in
combat. Both druids and mages have the ability to summon a familiar.
The necessary components for casting this spell differ depending on
the type of familiar summoned.  A familiar may or may not comply with
an order you give it, depending on what the order is and if the familiar
feels like being compliant.  However, nonetheless, they are exceedingly
loyal to their masters, quick to join them at a moment's notice.

There are rumors spreading throughout the more exclusive magic circles
that the gods are breeding new types of familiars with the ability to
increase in power much in the same way as their human masters.

Syntax:   cast 'call familiar' <type of familiar>

You can also dismiss your familiar if need be.

Although temporary, many magical constructs such as the portals of mages or

magic.  It is difficult or impossible to dispel or destroy such constructs
by normal means.
 
Shattering Resonance instead destroys such portals or beacons by non-magical 
means.  The bard creates a heavy resonance to shock the air around the 
construct, thereby shifting its alignment with the ethereal plane only slighty, 
but more than enough to debase the magic upon which the portal was founded.
 
 
The bard singing this powerful song must be able to see his or her target
however, as many such magical creations are cloaked in various types of
obfuscation.

a result of this, they are often able to create an extended song that will
not only provide a small measure of energy to their party in combat, but
also prevent them from falling asleep while there is work to be done.
While the bard is playing this loud and abrasive melody, neither he nor
any member of his group can sleep or be put to sleep.

While the damage caused by this song at its outset may be
minimal, it increases in damage as the bard increases their

that the bard is able to continue singing even while knocked off

Following help is available:
 
help HELP       - This text.
help            - List several basic commands.
 
Help searches for the word or words you specify.  An exact match is
required for help to return information.
In some cases an abbreviation may work, but in these cases that is
because the abbreviated keyword was hardcoded as a keyword in itself.
By all means, try help <abbreviation> to save yourself some time, but
if that does not work, try help <long form of whatever you want help on>
 
Example:
 > 'help magic missile'
    will find the help text for the magic missile spell.
 
 > 'help mag'
    will not match anything.
 
 > 'help prac'
    will find the help text for the practice topic, because 'prac' was
    hardcoded as a keyword for that topic.
 
Generally, as you are browsing the help topics, anything in all caps within
a help topic may be used as the keyword for a separate help topic in:
help <keyword>
 
The help topics have been made with the goal that if you can think of
a keyword or phrase that would make sense to have a help topic about,
then there should already be a topic about that.
For example, if you think to yourself, 'What happens if I die?'
You should be able to realize that you can type help death to find out.

Mana is a measure of your mental acuteness. Every spell requires a certain

subtracted from your total mana points. If not, only half of the amount is

L: 1
E:
Attributes are the stats that make up the backbone of your character.
Some decide how much you can carry, while others decide how often
your spell works.  Stats can be artifically raised by equipment or
permanently raised at the meta shop. Each race has a different cap
for each stat.  These caps can be found in each race's help file.

Note that while equipment can be used to raise an attribute to its
listed cap, this ONLY affects the statistices outlined in the helpfile
for each attribute. Meaning that to improve your skills, only a
NATURAL attribute can be used.  In short, +attribute (stats) items
can give you the maximum but will NOT affect your knowledge level for
skills or spells.  You must meta to improve these.

Each race's total maximum attributes add up to a total of 125. See
each race's individual help file for more detailed information.

Each attribute has a set of areas that they modifiy for your character
within the game.  This is also a part of the diversity of races.

The more intelligent your character is, the more likely they are

requisites that need INT.

A higher INT often allows for a bonus in many areas, whereas a lower INT
will often incur a penalty. All attributes can be increased at the meta
shop located west of the Albatross Tavern off of Sativa Street.

Your character's intelligence affects:
 - How well they improve their skills with each practice session
 - Chances of automatically improving in a skill or spell with use
 - Magic Resistance

Furthermore, for Bards, Anti-Paladins, Rangers, and Mages, INT affects:

Constitution (CON) is a rating of your character's health and hardiness.
The more resilliant your character is, the more likely they are
to be successful at skills or spells with primary or secondary
requisites that call for CON.

A higher CON often allows for a bonus in many areas, whereas a lower CON
will often incur a penalty. All attributes can be increased at the meta
shop located west of the Albatross Tavern off of Sativa Street.

Your character's constitution affects:
 - Movement and Hit Point regeneration per tick
 - Hit points gained at level
 - Poison resistance

Note: CON also plays a determining role in your character's life span.
      For all races (except trolls), a CON drop below 5 points will result
      in PERMANENT DEATH from which you CANNOT BE RESTORED.  All races
      (except trolls) lose CON as their main stat loss.

HITPOINTS
NONE
MANA, MOVEMENT, CONSTITUTION, META, CONDITION
L: 1
E:
One of the three vital statistics. The number of hit points you have
determines how much damage you can take before you die. Hit points
regenerate every tick, faster if you sleep or even rest. The amount of
hit points gained per level depends on the constitution among other
things. Hit points can also be purchased at the meta shop.

L: 1
E:
The Meta-physician will offer various services for sale, not the least
of which is to exchange some of your gold coins for platinum coins.
You will need platinum coins to purchase any other services the
Meta-physician has to offer.
 
Type 'LIST' when with him to see the services he offers, such as how to
exchange gold for platinum.
 
Note also, that the Meta-Physician is only interested in your "current"
state.  Meaning, if you are wearing equipment that increases your mana,
hit points, ki, or moves, he will take this into account and charge you
more accordingly.  Similarly, if you are wearing equipment that lowers
these values, you will be charged less!

The Meta-physician will not respond to anyone simply by saying hello to
him.  Indeed, the Meta-physician frowns upon informality, and if one
were to use the short version of hello, by typing: hi meta, the
Meta-physician would respond with a quick and decisive harshness.
 
Note: You must be at least level 10 to use the Meta-Physicians's services.

L: 1
E:
Every so many seconds real time (about a minute), a mud hour passes.
During this time hit, mana, move, and ki points regenerate. These points
regenerate slowly over several intervals during each tick.

The intervals mentioned above are called 'pulses', and each pulse is
roughly 1/4 of a tick.

NONE
RULES, LINK, MULTIPLAYING, IMM LINKDEAD
L: 1
E:
A linkdead is a player who lost their link before quitting out of the
game. This happens for a number of reasons, ranging from the player
cutting link on purpose in order to change equipment, to a player having
their local server crash. A linkdead is easily recognized as one by the
'*linkdead*' in front of their name.

Note: Linkdeads characters CAN be stolen from.

Don't put *linkdead* in front of your name.  You will be asked to remove
it.  If you don't, you will lose this ability.
 
Immortal note: The admin helpfile for this command is listed as "IMM LINKDEAD".

LINK
NONE

RULES, SAVE, RENT
L: 1
E:
A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This could
hurt you in various ways.  Basically you are no safer as a linkdead than
as a player with active control over your character.

I. If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem.  The only solution we
   can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible, so that
   you might proceed with establishing your new (and hopefully improved)
   link.

II. Due to blatant misuse of disconnecting, a reconnect lag has been
installed into the game.  After reconnecting you will be subject to a
bit of lag for a few seconds.  This is regardless of if you had previously
dropped link, or if you had kept your link live right up till the fresh
reconnect.

Some people like to break their link instead of quitting.  We have changed
link death and quitting so that dropping your link and just letting the
character lay there for hours on end while linkdead will cost you more
than if you had just typed "quit".  Please use the quit command.

If you have a small display you might want to use this command. It turns
off (or on) the extra new line after output to your screen causing things
to be closer together.  This allows more information on your screen at

Throughout the mud are safe rooms.  You cannot be attacked in a safe
room unless you have a pkiller flag on you.  Thieves will also be unable
to steal in a safe room.  Safe rooms in Sorpigal include the Tavern,
the donations room, the board room, the Undertaker, the Meta Shop,
and a few others.  Be warned that a safe room may still allow the use
of magic -- which isn't so safe in some cases.

You cannot take equipment from the corpse of a player who has been
killed by a mob unless that player has consented to the action.  To
enable another player to take items from your corpse:

type:  consent <playername>

Consented players are also able to buy your corpse at the Undertaker.

Syntax:   consent <player>

$BNote 1:$R You may not consent anyone under level 10.
 
$BNote 2:$R You will NOT receive a "pthief" or "gold_thief" flag for any
players corpse that you loot items or coins from when you are consented.

When you are killed by a mob, you leave a corpse, on which all of your
gold and equipment, with the exception of any godload items, remains.
You cannot take items from another player's corpse unless they have
consented.

When you are killed by another player, you will not leave a corpse
unless you have stolen from another player.

Note: Player characters under level 10 do not leave a corpse. Likewise,
      you may not consent a player character under level 10 to retrieve
      your equipment.

E:
A paladin, due to his altruistic nature and stalwart devotion to his god,
has the ability to work minor miracles once in a while.  A paladin
skilled in the art of laying hands has the ability to infuse another with
life force, restoring a portion of their target's vitality.  However, such
miracles always come at a cost, as the paladin practicing this skill will
be almost completely incapacitated by the sheer strain on his or her
being.  Being as such, it is important for the paladin to be in at least
fair health to attempt such a draining exercise.  It is also important to
note that a paladin must not take a skill of this magnitude lightly, as
their god will only grant this power on special occasions.

themselves with a mental shield so that when an opponent directs a spell at
him, the two foes will engage in a battle of the brains. If the mage wins
this encounter then the spell will be disolved, otherwise the spell will
go through as normal. Due to the exhausting nature of this activity, it can
only be undertaken at prolonged intervals.

groupings: Fire, Cold, Energy, Acid, Magic, and Poison.

A successful "saving throw" generally has beneficial effects such as:
negating a spells effect or halving its damage.

SQ
QUEST SKILL, PRACTICE, SKILLS, LEARN, WORLD
L: 1
E:
The guilds of Sorpigal have employed, as their guildmasters, some of the
world's finest practitioners of their arts. However, none of these masters
know everything, nor are they willing to impart everything that they
do know upon an unproven adventurer. Therefore, in order to acquire many
skills and spells you will need to undertake what is known as a skill
quest. These will vary in difficulty according to the significance of
the skill in question. The quests themselves can come in many different
forms: some ask you to find a specific mob to ask [in which case, saying
'teach me please' in the same room as the mob usually will suffice],
others will including the finding and bringing back of certain desired
items, and still others will need the adventurer to slaughter a particular
mob [in which case getting the killing blow is very important]. Your
guildmaster should be able to provide you with a starting point for your
quest when you first try to practice a new skill or spell.

You should be advised that skill quests are not easy and simply
reaching the level at which one may reveal the clue for a certain quest
does not mean that one is ready for it. Many quests can not be completed
alone and it will behoove the quester to enlist the help of other
adventurers. Most importantly, skill quests will test your knowledge of
the world and in order to complete these quests you are encouraged to
explore, explore, and explore. Don't be surprised if, while going about
one quest, you stumble upon the solution to an entirely different
quest. Finally, once you have completed a skill quest, especially one
that requires a significant amount of thinking and exploring, you will
be in posession of priveledged information which you might find prudent
to withhold from other players. Skill quests are fun, yet at the same
time they require a good deal of effort, and in some instances the loss
to whom, you decide to give valuable skill quest information.

Here is a skill quest for a hypothetical skill named
"Random-Fighting-Skill":

>practice random-fighting-skill
Your guildmaster says 'I can not teach you this, but one regal brassmaster
by name of Flexx could most surely help you.'

  [At this point you would wander the world until you find Flexx]

>look
Flexx the grizzled trainer is here, begging for someone to instruct.
>say teach me please?
You say 'teach me please?'
Flexx turns your way, smiles, then proceeds to take you through numerous
fighting maneuvers.
Flexx says 'Oh, I so enjoy helping human figures improve in their
art forms.' You have learned Random-Fighting-Skill

Bards make use of their class's major abilities by singing their songs.

If the song name is more than one word then the song name must be
placed within single quotation marks should you choose to type out the
whole name.
 
$B$3Syntax:   $7sing '<long name of song>' [target]$R
 
Some songs are continuous, the bard will continue singing them until
they run out of ki (in the case of a song which continues to drain ki),
or the bard sings a different song. The effect of these songs will exist
as long as the bard is still singing. Other songs the bard will sing
through once and end the song, with the effect occuring upon finish.
 
The bard can quit singing entirely by singing the stop song: sing 'stop'
A bard can view a list of all the songs which they are currently able
to sing by using the 'listsongs' song: sing listsongs
 
Songs are acquired in the same way as spells and skills, that is,
by gaining levels and completing skill quests.

L: 1
E:
The primary role of "light" on Dark Castle has to do with the
illumination of rooms.  If it is night, or if a room is flagged
to be "dark" at all times, a player without infravision or any
light source type items (lantern, torch, glowing equipment) will
not be able to see any objects or mobs in that room, nor will
they be able to read that room's description.  To light up a room,
one may cast "continual light" in that room or on their equipment
(to add a permanent light source), or they can hold a lantern (or
some other suitable light source).  In addition, some rooms may
require more "light" to illuminate it than others.

L: 1
E:
Rooms in the game vary in the degree to which they are lit. Most rooms are
lit up and thus you can see everything in these rooms. However, some rooms
are dark and you will get the message "It is pitch black..." instead of
a room description in these rooms. Unless you have infravision, you will
also have trouble seeing mobs, and players in these rooms.
There are aids which you can use to help yourself see in these Darkened
rooms. Light sources, such as torches and laterns may be purchased in
town or found throughout the world. Glowing equipment can also be used
to increase light levels. Note that some rooms are exceptionally dark
and will require multiple light sources in order to light up a room to
where you can see everything.

Outside rooms will be light or dark depending upon the time of the day.

There is also a 'dark' flag on some items that prevents you from identifying
them.

E:
Auto-improvement is the process by which the repeated use of an ability
will increase your skill level (much as if you had practiced it in
your guild.)  Actual improvement will occur at random intervals, but
in general, the more you make use of an ability, the better the
chance that it will improve.
 
Higher stats in the attributes associated with the $BSKILL GROUP$R
for any given ability also increases the chance for auto-improvement.
 
All other things being equal, any given ability will vary in how
quickly (or slowly) they tend to improve based upon the ability's 
difficulty (better skills being more difficult).
 
$BThere are 3 improvement levels for abilities.$R

CLASSES, SKILLS, SPELLS, GAIN, LEVEL, PRACTICE, META
L: 1
E:
$B$3ABOUT PROFESSIONS$R
Once your character has achieved level 50 and is ready to "gain" to
level 51, you will be asked to select one of the professions
available to your class.  Each class has several (currently two)
profession choices available to them and, once selected, your
character will become skilled in the chosen profession.
 
$B$3CHANGING PROFESSIONS$R
Once selected, professions may NOT be changed under any circumstances
until you reach level 60.  Once you have reached level 60, you may,
if you so desire, visit the meta physician and pay to change your
profession.  Conveniently, the platinum your guild provides you as
you level from 51 to 60 for the first (and only the first) time, is
roughly equal to the cost of changing professions.
 
Changing your profession is not something to be taken lightly and
as such, is an expensive undertaking.  Once payment has been made,
your character will be reset to level 51 and you may then select a
new profession.  Your selection may not be the same profession you
were immediately prior to changing.
 
Though your character is set back to level 51 when a change of
profession is made, you will still retain any stats (mana, hp, moves,
ki, etc) that you previously acquired during your levelling up to 60.
You may then level up and gain as normal en route to 60 once again.
Note that only your hp, mana, moves, and ki will improve as you
re-level to 60.  Other stats that previously advanced (saves for
example) will remain the same as they were during your first gain to
level 60.
 
$B$3SKILLS AND PROFESSIONS$R
Your character has numerous skill options available to them based
upon the profession you have selected.  This of course is the main
reason for choosing a profession in the first place!
 
Each class has two skills that are the same for ALL professions and
three that vary from profession to profession.
 
The two "all profession" skills for your class are earned at level 51
and level 55.  The three "profession specific" skills for the
profession you have chosen are gained at levels 53, 57, and 60.
 
$B$3PROFESSION OPTIONS$R
As it currently stands, there are two profession options for each
class, though may more be added at a later date.  The professions for
each class are as follows:

L: 1

Items flagged $BUNIQUE$R will restrict players from having more than one of
that item.
 
Many items which are flagged UNIQUE are done so to prevent players from
hoarding these items, others are UNIQUE because the immortals feel that
players shouldn't be able to use more than one of these items at the
same time, possibly because the item is abnormally powerful.
 
The $BNO_SCRAP$R flag does just what it says, an item flagged such will not
scrap regardless of the amount of damage it takes.  It is predominatly
used on parts required to complete various quests within the game.

ITEM FLAGS, EQUIPMENT FLAGS
L: 1
E:
Items which are designated as NO TRADE can not be transfered to another
player in any way. It is therefore very important when you desire a NO
TRADE item that *you* are the one to pick it up, or loot the corpse of
the mob that carries it, not another group member or anyone else.

If somebody manages to steal a NO TRADE flagged item, instead of it going
into the thief's inventory, it will *poof* into the nether void, never to
be seen again.

NO TRADE items can not be picked up, or removed from a container in
conjunction with the 'get all' or 'get all.[item keyword]' commands. They
can still be gotten, however, but only individually.
 
Note that any attempt to loot a NOTRADE item from a player's corpse
that is NOT your own will also result in it "poofing".

Glowing items will emit a small amount of light when they are worn which
can be helpful in lighting up dark rooms. Some items can be given this
glowing ability by means of the continual light spell.

Humming items currently have no special effects.

Newbie items cannot be stolen or put into containers.

seen by those who have a special ability allowing them to see invisible
things.

Items with the nonotice flag are few and far between. When laying on
the ground they will not be seen when looking at a room.  Additionally
they will not be picked up when a "get all" command is used.
 
Nodrop items are cursed. They can not be dropped, given away, or
sacrificed.
 
Nosave items will, like keys, disappear when the person with it quits
out of the game, or when the mud reboots.
 
Objects with the Nolocate flag can not be found by the 'locate object'
spell.

E:
Monks are ascetic wanderers and expert martial artists.  They have
withdrawn from traditional life to find peace and harmony from within.
 
Though they can wield some weapons, monks are much more inclined to
use their lethal kicks and punches in combat, particularly at higher
levels of skill.
 
Capable of tremendous offensive and spiritual feats, monks are also an
exceedly well rounded defensive class.  Their defensive prowess however
extends much more from their speed and uncanny reactions than the
wearing of excessively heavy armors. 
 
Monks are one of the few classes which can harness the power of mystical
$BKI$R energy.
 
The monk's quiet life of meditation, strict training, and tremendous
internal focus often surface through the physical rigours of a $BSENSEI$R
or the quiet mysticism of a $BSPIRITUALIST$R.

Though they do not fare particularly well in melee combat and do not
possess a tremendous offensive arsenal, their tremendous healing and
defensive powers make them capable of outlasting opponents in a fierce
battle of attrition.
 
Clerics can be of any alignment as the pantheon of gods come in all
varieties.  Be they $BZEALOT$R or $BRITUALIST$R, good or evil, devout
or deviant, clerics are one of the most important classes in the realms.

WIZARD
CLASSES, RACES, CAST, NEWBIE MAGE, SPELLBINDER, WARMAGE
L: 1
E:
Mages on Dark Castle are spellcasters and magic users of potentially
limitless power.  They live, and occasionally die, by their incantations.
Most of their time is spent in intense study, and therefore, mages tend
to be fairly weak and frail.
 
Due to their lack of allegiance to any of the pantheonn of deities, they
possess little healing power.  Without magical augmentation, a mage has
the least number of attacks of any of the other classes.  As compensation
for these fairly significant restrictions, mages have at their disposal
an arsenal of spells unmatched by any others.
 
Be they a powerful and commanding $BWARMAGE$R or mysterious and lethal
$BSPELLBINDER$R, mages are among the greatest forces throughout the realms.
 
Minimum Attribute Requirements:  $B15 Int$R

their expertise in the areas of stealth, deceit, and trickery more
than make up for any shortcomings they might have in other areas.
The expession "nothing is beyond a hungry thief" contains more than
a little truth.
 
From the nimble fingers of a cunning $BPILFERER$R to the silent and
deadly blades of the $BASSASSIN$R, thieves are a common sight in
cities and towns throughout the land.

ANTIPAL
CLASSES, RACES, CAST, NEWBIE ANTI, REAVER, CULTIST
L: 1
E:
While the name suggests that this class is a fallen paladin, or one
which takes up conflict with the holy breed--nothing could be farther
from the truth.  The name is a misnomer; "Anti-Paladins" are
treacherous scoundrels who are practiced in the ways of combat,
stealth, wizardry, and even some black clerical arts to further their
own ends.
 
Anti-Paladins are jacks-of-all-trades, much like Rangers, yet those of
the forest ilk tend to prefer living comrades...
Whether insidious $BCULTIST$R or sinister $BREAVER$R, Anti-Paladins
are pariahs that are both loathed and feared throughout the realms.
 
Children of the darkness, Anti-Paladins grow weaker as they veer
from the path of the service of evil.  It is also rumored that such
dark warriors have an innate ability to ward off the approach of their
evil brethren.
 
Only humans, orcs, or dwarves may be come an Anti-Paladin.

Paladins are the Holy Knights of the Gods. They are incorrigibly
good and noble with unbending values and dedication to right. Their
inherit their power directly from the Gods but only if they remain
dedicated to the utmost "goodness" (see $Bhelp ALIGNMENT$R). Should
a paladin turn to the side of darkness, their powers will be all
but worthless.
 
As a "hybrid class", paladins have both combat skills and magic at
their disposal, though not to as high a level as a pure melee or
caster class might.  Paladins also possess the abilty to ward off
those of good alignment who might otherwise attempt to harm intruders.
 
Whether a noble and righteous $BTEMPLAR$R or disciplined and deadly
$BINQUISITOR$R, a Paladin always stands for truth, justice, and honour.

Only humans, elves, and dwarves may become a paladin.

E:
The Barbarian class is just how it sounds--big, dumb, and powerful
fighters. Barbarians anger easily, forgive easily, and love a good
time and wild brawl.  Treat them as you might a rowdy child.
 
Barbarians are best known for their impetuous nature and awesome
prowess in battle.  Whether you face a mighty $BCHIEFTAIN$R or wild
$BATTLERAGER$R, it's never a good idea to be on the wrong side of
an angry barbarian!
 
Barbarian battle skills are centered primarily around dealing massive
amounts of melee damage as quickly as possible.  As a result of the
tremendous amounts of damage barbarians are able to dish out in a
wild and furious assault, they are somewhat less defensive than other
melee classes.
 
$BNote:$R Due to their very tiny size and non-combative nature,
      characters of the $BPixie$R race may not become barbarians.

possess a variety of powerful abilities that allow them to deal with
most any situation that might arise.
 
While not quite as in tune with the spirits of nature as the druids,
rangers can still exercise a very potent control over the beasts and
plants of the woods. They can tame the wild animals with but a look,

L: 1
E:
Bards are the ancient storytellers and singers of Sorpigal. They keep
alive the legends and history of the realms through song and dance.
 
Their voices, when focused through the power of KI can at times
become enchanting, summoning, confusing, or even lethal.  Woven with
spiritual ki powers, bards have a multitude of songs at their disposal
for various occasions ranging from a soothing and healing tune to a
rousing call to battle!
 
The bard's music is often exceptionally powerful when employed as a
support for groups of adventurers travelling the most dangerous of
roads.  Be they a $BTROUBADOUR$R or $BMINSTREL$R, a bard always has
a quick wit and merry tune for any occasion!

be quite formidable opponents.
 
Specializing in a host of magical abilities that harness the
forces of nature, Druids can perform feats of power such as:
calling forth a storm of lightning to slay their foes, debilitating
the health of an opponent, or even summoning a being from the
elemental planes to do their bidding!

QUEST SKILLS, SING, CLASSES, TAME, BARD, CHARMIE EQ
L: 1
E:
Throughout the ages, minstrels have learned how to engage their audience
with both story and song.  Some of the more clever practicioners of this
merry profession have perfected the art of mesmerizing those who hear
their hypnotic voice.  To this effect, bards have developed a song that
allows them to charm one creature (at a time) into being completely loyal
to their every whim and wish.  This hypnotic harmony, however, only lasts
so long, and the bard must be wary of their victim's negative reaction to
being charmed.

Syntax:  sing 'hypnotic harmony' <target>
The number of "hypnotized" creatures a bard can control is based upon
the bard's level.  The success of harmony is based upon how well the
bard knows the hypnotic harmony song.
 
A bard receives: $Blevel/5$R "slots" for hypnotizing mobs.
Mobs use up slots in the following manner:
 
Level 50 mob - $B10 slots$R
Level 41-49  - $B7 slots$R
Level 31-40  - $B5 slots$R
Level 21-30  - $B3 slots$R
Level 11-20  - $B2 slots$R
Level  1-10  - $B1 slot$R
 
Note: The MOST charmed mobs a bard can command at once, regardless
      of "slots" open is 3.

Note that "animal" types of charmed creatures have more restrictive
equpment limitations than "humanoid" types of creatures.  Experiment
with different charmed creatures to discover the restrictions.

QUEST SKILLS, SKILLS, PALADIN, SKILL QUEST
L: 1
E:
Paladin quest skill

Legend has it that the ancient Paladins had a remarkable protective
spell that would cut by half all damage they inncured. Unfortunately
much of that knowledge has been lost and those purporting to have this
ability, can only conjure it in less powerful forms. There is, however,
one cloistered school of Paladins who have retained most of this ancient
learning. They have devised a newer form of this ancient sanctuary that,
while it will not work in conjuction with it's newer clones, results in
an unfathomable degree of protection. It is referred to as the holy aura

There are a few drawbacks: the spell can not be cast on others, it does
not stack with normal sanctuary, and the paladin must choose whether they
want the protection to cover physical or magical damage  Furthermore, due
to the strength and severity of asking this boon of your god, the casting
of Holy Aura reduces your "good standing" with them and can only be cast
once per day.

Syntax:   cast 'holy aura' physical (to protect against physical damage)
          cast 'holy aura' magic (to protect against magic and ki/songs)

Barbarians--lacking the cunning of thieves, the foresight of antipaladins,
or the quickness of rangers--are known to often charge impetuously
into dangerous situations with disastrous consequences. Sensing their
weakness, one tribe of barbarians has developed the technique of the
bullrush. A barbarian possessing this ability can enter a room populated
with enemies and initiate an attack before anyone has a chance to
respond. Only a premeditated ambush can foil this aggression.

SLANG
VOCABULARY
GLOSSARY
DICTONARY
JARGON
NEWBIE
L: 1
E:
The mud community has a lot of unique expressions which may be unknown
to a new player. Here is a brief list which you might want to familarize
yourself with.

imm     - Immortal
imp     - Implementor, the highest level immortal
imp'ed  - Not to be confused with the past tense of an implementor,
          which makes no sense.
          It actually refers to some procedure or bit of code, or a new
          area being implemented.
mob     - Mobile, a 'monster' or 'creature'
pc      - A player character
npc     - Non Player Character, same as a mob

rk      - Real kill, the death of a player by a mobile.
rkill   -
   As a noun: The event of a player getting killed by a mobile. This may
              or may not be caused by another player intentionally.
              Example:
              "I've been the victim of 3 rkills today" meaning the speak-
              er's character was killed by a mobile three times that day.

   As a verb: The action of causing someone to be killed by a mob.
              Examples:
              "Wexx rkilled Mindcrime" meaning Wexx caused Mindcrime
               to get killed by a mobile.
              "I got rkilled by a poodle" meaning the speaker let himself
              get killed by a poodle.

cr    - Corpse Retrieval, the act of trying to recover (or having someone
        recover for you) all of your equipment from your corpse after a
        rk (see above) without going to the morgue to purchase it.
        Example:
        gossip  I just died, can anyone do a CR for me?

pk    - Player kill, the death of a player by another player
pkill -
   As a noun: "Stromboli has 50 pkills already today!" meaning Stromboli
              killed other players 50 times that day.

   As a verb: "Argento is a bastard, all he does is pkill people!" meaning
              Argento is of illegitimate birth and kills other players.

dt    - Death trap, a room containing monsters that will guarantee a rkill
sq    - Skill quest (the generic term includes spell quests)
quest skill - I know that it seems strange to say that a quest skill and
              a skill quest are different things, but thats the way it is.
              This is like a standard skill quest, except that it is
              signifigantly more complex and difficult.
              Generally each class has but one such quest skill.
              The generic term includes spell quests.

quest sq    - Sometimes a quest skill is refered to as a
              "quest skill quest".  Again, I know this seems
              redundant, but thats the jargon that has evolved here.

ld    - Linkdead, someone who has lost their connection to the mud without
        properly quitting out.

nod   - an expression of agreement

chode - an derogatory reference towards another (ie. that guy's a chode!)

tank  - If you are new here but not new to mudding, you may have used the
        term "buffer" to mean the same thing.
        The "tank" in any battle is whoever or whatever, on your side of
        fight, that is taking whatever the other side of the battle is
        dishing out.  Or getting hurt in other words.
        Note that if the other side of the battle has multiple hitters
        on their side, your side may have multiple tanks (like it or not).

agro  - This refers to a mob attacking just because it doesn't like the
        way you look.  Whoever is aggroed would then also be the tank
        in your side of the fight.

sanc  - Sanctuary, a cleric and paladin spell

di    - Detect invisiblity, a spell that lets
        one see invisible people and items.

Fakesell - Commiting to sell an item over the auction (or other) channel
           and failing to hand over the item after the payment has been
           received.  Often the fakeseller doesn't even have the item
           they're "selling"

noob - A newbie. If you don't know this expression, consider yourself one.
newbie - noob, a new player

nerf - what Immortals do to stats on items
nerfed - an item that has had an Immortal (likely Apocalypse) edit it

Expressions of humor
--------------------

rofl - Rolling On the Floor Laughing
lol  - Laughing Out Loud

:) :-) - The regular smiley faces

  ^_^  - The gay anime smiley face

  Oo   - The incredulous "squinting" smiley

L: 1
E:
Obviously you are new. Here is a brief list of steps to get you on
your feet

1) If you havn't done so already type: toggle ansi or toggle vt100.
   Usually the former is best.  This will make the game look much more
   lively. For more info see help toggle.

2) You will also want to give yourself a useful prompt.
   Here are some examples:

   For a pure fighter class (warrior, thief, or barbarian) type:
   prompt Hps: %h/%H  Move: %v/%V Tank: %t Opp %f>

   For a class that uses ki (monk, bard) type:
   prompt Hps: %h/%H  Ki: %k/%K  Move: %v/%V Tank: %t Opp %f>

   For spellcaster classes
   (cleric, mage, druid, ranger, paladin, anti) use:
   prompt Hps: %h/%H  Mana: %m/%M  Move: %v/%V Tank: %t Opp %f>

   Prompt can become much more elaborate so be sure to check out
   "help prompt" sometime.

3) Go up into the newbie school.

You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come in to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the musics high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
Youre in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...

You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen

Youre a teaser, you turn em on
Leave them burning and then youre gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
Youre in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...

ZEDIT, ZEDIT EQ, ZEDIT TYPE, ZEDIT IF
L: 103
E:
When you are building the zonefile (zfile) for your area you will need
to define the actions and load states of any doors in your zone with
door commands.

These commands are traditionally put at the start of the zonefile before
any mobs or objects or other commands.  This makes it easy reference
for future editors.

Step by step, to set a door command, you do the following:

1) zedit edit <line#> type D
    - This will set the line you are editing to a "door" command.

2) zedit edit <line#> if <if #>
     - This is where you will define when you want the door command to execute.
      (read help ZEDIT IF for details) - This is usually a "0".

3) zedit edit <line#> 1 <room #>
    - This indicates the room that the door is in.

4) zedit edit <line#> 2 <direction#>
    - This is where you indicate the direction of the door in the room.
$BDirections: 0 = north, 1 = east, 2 = south, 3 = west, 4 = up, 5 = down$R

5) zedit edit <line#> 3 <state#>
    - This how the door will load when the comand is executred.
$BStates: 0 = open, 1 = closed and unlocked, 2 = closed and locked$R

6) zedit edit <line#> comment <comment text>
    - This is where you indicate the door's information and destination.

Note that it is very important to comment your zonefile lines as to
keep things easily understood for future Imms.  Door commends should
usually be commented with something like:
"Door leading east to the guard's room." (for example)

$BImportant$R: make SURE you create a door closing command for BOTH
sides of a door.  Meaning both entry room and destination room.
This is EXTREMELY important (unless the door exists only one side of
the exit and not the other) because it will cause errors in door loading
if both sides are not set to function.

These are the numbers for placing an object on a mob in zedit.

A couple of warnings here.  You can equip a mob with eq that
normally doesn't allow it to be worn that way.  You can wear
boots on head, or a sword in ear, but you CANNOT overload any
eq slots.  Like, you can't wear  two head items, or a shield,
light, and held obj.  The mud won't boot up.  Bilateral eq
(rings, earrings, etc.) must fill both slots, you can't put
two on the same neck slot.

         0 = light                11 = shield
         1 = right finger         12 = about
         2 = left finger          13 = waist

Damage Type #s for Weapons (v4 slot on stat sheet):
===================================================
For Builders:
-
0 & 1 = whip (use 1 unless otherwise instructed)
2 & 3 = slash (use 3 unless otherwise instructed)
4 & 5 = crush (use 5 unless otherwise instructed)
6 & 7 = pound (use 7 unless otherwise instructed)
8 & 9 = sting (8 = non-backstab, 9 = backstab)
10 & 11 = pierce (10 = non-backstab, 11 = backstab)
===================================================
For Artificial Intelligence coders:
-
Builders will normally use the odd numbers
for whip, slash, crush, and pound.
-
AI coders should use the number from the above table
which cooresponds to the damage type they care about.
for sting or pierce, you can specify either stabby or not.
to specify both stabby and NOT stabby, you would need to
do something like this:
-
if isweappri($$n) == 8
or isweappri($$n) == 9
This would return true if $$n was wielding any stinging
weapon, stabby or not.  You can also use the standard
<> =< =>, so you can specify any stinger/peircer with
this, for example.
-
if isweappri($$n) > 7
-
If $$n is not wielding any weapon, there is no error.
It simply returns false.

E:
The Hardcore Rules are for those who feel DC has become a milk and cookies
mud. Thanks to Demon Uln'hyrr for the grand Hardcore theme. The Rulz:

1. You may not tell anyone who your alts are or who you are in real life.
2. In addition to the starting mud school eq, you may only wear the eq of
   mobs which you personally kill which means...
        a. no getting eq from donation
        b. no buying eq from auction
        c. no buying from shops EXCEPT that which is normally sold there
        d. no pstealing eq, or looting player corpses including pthieves.
3. No grouping with anyone who isn't playing by the hardcore rules
   (Put Hardcore next to your name to identify yourself to the other
    hardcore players.)

The procedit command is used to create and edit a mobile's special
procedures.

Syntax:  procedit [mob_num] [field] [arg]

Typing 'procedit' without any arguments will result in the following
output:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Edit a field with no args for help on that field.
  The field must be one of the following:
               add            remove              type           arglist
           command              list
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Add-     Creates a new procedure.
2. Remove-  Removes the specified procedure, by number.
3. Type-    Modifies the 'trigger type' of the specified proc.
4. Arglist- Modifies the argument listing for for the specified proc.
5. Command- Puts you into 'editor' mode to write in the actual proc.
6. List-    Lists all of the procedures on the specified mobile.

For more information, please see the following helpfiles:
  help MPTYPE      (lists the various trigger types)
  help MPARGLIST   (explanation on the function of the arglist)
  help MPIF        (lists the available 'ifchecks')

L: 1
E:
Dark Castle is home to several different kinds of quests, each serving
its own purpose in the overall mechanics of the game.  These include:
 
$B$2Skill Quests:$R  Sometimes your guildmaster may ask you to embark on a quest
               to seek a teacher for a particular skill, spell, or song. 
               This is called a "skill quest".  Every class on Dark Castle
               has its own set of skill quests. See $BHELP SKILL QUEST$R for
               more details.
 
$B$2Quest Skill:$R   Not to be confused with "Skill Quests", Quest Skills are a
               special skill/song/spell that each class can acquire at
               level 50. To acquire these skills however, you must embark
               upon a quest that is both longer and more complicated than
               a normal skill quest.  See $BHELP QUEST SKILLS$R for more
               details.
 
$B$2Mini-Quests:$R   Some areas of Dark Castle house special mobiles that will
               offer a PC the chance to complete a quest.  More often than
               not, the PC will be rewarded upon completion of the mini-
               quest.
 
$B$2Quest Master:$R  In the Quester's Haven Inn in town you will find Phire, the
               Quest Master.  He will provide a clue to your character (for
               a fee of course) that you then need to puzzle out and resolve,
               returning to him a specified item.  Through completion of such
               tasks, you can earn "Quest Points" (or Qpoints in your score
               sheet). See $BHELP QUEST SYSTEM$R or $BHELP QUEST MASTER$R for more.

MPSYNTAX

NONE
PROCEDIT, MPCOMMANDS, MPIF, MPTYPE
L: 103
E:
The easiest way to understand the syntax for mob procedures is through
example.  To this end, we will first look at the two main syntaxes for
mob procedures, and end with an example.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax for Mob Procedures:

">" {trigger_type} " " {argument_list}  NL
{program_command_1} NL
{program_command_2} NL
{program_command_3} NL
     .   .   .
{program_command_N} NL
 NL

-- Explanations

A TRIGGER_TYPE is one of the available triggers.
A PROGRAM_COMMAND can be any legal mud command, or a control flow 
command.
The ARGUMENT_LIST depends upon the trigger, but it is always parsed 
into the system as a character string.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax for Flow Control:

"if" " " {if_check_1} "(" {argument} ")" [ {operator} {value} ] NL
[ "or" " " {if_check_2} "(" {argument} ")" [ {operator} {value} ] NL ]
                        .           .           .
[ "or" " " {if_check_N} "(" {argument} ")" [ {operator} {value} ] NL ]
[ {program_command_1} NL ]
[ {program_command_2} NL ]
      .   .   .
[ "break" NL ]
      .   .   .
[ {program_command_N} NL ]
[ "else" NL ]
[ {program_command_1} NL ]
[ {program_command_2} NL ]
      .   .   .
[ "break" NL ]
      .   .   .
[ {program_command_N} NL ]
"endif" NL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Example:

>act_prog p pokes you in the
if isnpc($$n)
   chuckle
   poke $$n
else
   if level($$n) <= 5
   or isgood($$n)
      tell $$n I would rather you didnt poke me.
   else
      if level($$n)>15
         scream
         say Ya know $$n. I hate being poked!!!
         kill $$n
         break
      endif
      slap $$n
      shout MOMMY!!! $$N is poking me.
   endif
endif
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok... time to translate... the trigger will only happen when the mobile 
gets the message "... pokes you in the ..." If the offender (recall the 
$$n and $$N refer to the char who did the poking...) is an NPC, then the 
mobile merely chuckles and pokes back. If the offender was a PC then 
good and low level characters get a warning, high level chars get 
attacked, and midlevel chars get slapped and whined at.

Note that two of these mobiles could easily get into an infinite poke 
war which slows down (or frequently crashes) the mud just a bit :(
Be very careful about things like that if you can. (i.e dont respond 
to a poke with a poke, and try not to let heavily programmed robot 
mobiles wander around together. More on that is given above.)

Also, it is clear that the 'order' command could get confused with 
the 'or' control flow. However, this is only the case when 'order' 
is abbreviated to its two letter form, and placed immediately following 
an 'if' line. Thus, if you want to be that malicious in trying to break 
the MOBprogram code, no one is going to stand in your way (However, the 
result of this would be a bug message and a bail out from the ifcheck 
so things dont really break).

MPTYPE
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
L: 103
E:
A 'trigger type' is an available kind of 'trigger' that will fire off
the associate procedure when it is 'tripped'.

Syntax:  procedit [mob_num] type <prog> <newtype>

Valid types:
  1 -       act_prog
  2 -    speech_prog
  3 -      rand_prog
  4 -     fight_prog
  5 -     death_prog
  6 -  hitprcnt_prog
  7 -     entry_prog
  8 -     greet_prog
  9 - all_greet_prog
 10 -      give_prog
 11 -     bribe_prog
 12 -     catch_prog
 13 -    attack_prog
 14 -     arand_prog
 15 -      load_prog
 16 -   can_see_prog
 17 -    damage_prog

Each of the valid types above has it's own associated helpfile.
Please refer to these helpfiles for more information on each
type of trigger.

Note that the first successful bribe_prog, give_prog, hitprcnt_prog,
death_prog, fight_prog, rand_prog and entry_prog is the only one 
which is executed.  All the successful greet (all) progs, speech_progs, 
and act_progs will be done. This is the best arrangement we found for 
handling situations where you imported several MOBprogram files for a 
mobile.  If you are going to write lots of little files and piece them 
together to create the effect you want, it is advisible to not mix things 
together all that much, otherwise you have to pay close attention to the 
order in which the programs are added to the link list.

Also, no MOBprograms will be successful when the mobile is charmed (since 
it has no self violation, it should act like it has none) to protect mobiles 
which are given special powers from being implemented by a player. One bug 
we had in early testing was a player who charmed a mobile and then used its 
aggressive greet_prog to attack other players.
#
~
ACT_PROG
ACTPROG
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  act_prog [p] <ARGUMENT>

The argument is a list of keywords separated by spaces. If the
first word is the character 'p' by itself then the rest of the 
word list is considered to be a phrase.  The trigger is activated 
whenver a keyword (or the phrase) is contained in the act() message. 
Both the phrase and keywordsare case insensitive.

NOTE: Most general trigger. Applies to almost every event which 
happens in the mud. Anytime the function act() is called with a 
message to be delivered TO_CHAR,TO_VICT,TO_ROOM,etc. the act can be 
triggered.  Basically this will trigger on almost everything you'll 
ever want (and some things you wont as well) For example: MOBprogram: 
">act_prog p pokes you in the ribs." This trigger will only be activated 
if a mobile receives a message in which the above five words are found 
in the exact order and spacing given. Note that the period is needed 
because the words must be found on their own. This eliminates confusion 
when the keyword is 'hi' and a message with the word 'this' is being 
checked.
#
~
SPEECH_PROG
SPEECHPROG
NONE
NONE
NONE
ACT_PROG
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  speech_prog [p] <ARGUMENT>

The argument is the same as for an act_prog.

NOTE: This is only triggered when the keyword or phrase 
is contained in a message which has been said by a PC in 
the same room as the mob. The PC restriction is not necessary, 
but makes infinite loops between two talking mobiles impossible. 
It also makes it impossible for two NPC's to stand and discuss 
the weather however.

NOTE: Only the first matching speech_prog will be executed.  So 
if you have a trigger on "hi" and "mob" and a player says "hi mob" 
only the first one in the prog list will go off.
#
~
RAND_PROG
RANDPROG
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  rand_prog <NUMBER>

The argument is a number betweeen 1 and 100 inclusive.

NOTE: This trigger is checked at each PULSE_MOBILE and if the argument 
is greater than a percentage roll the trigger is activated. This will 
happen even if there is no PC in the room with the mob, but there must 
be players in the same area. It is useful to give mobiles a bit of a 
personality. For instance a janitor who stops to spit tobacco, or complain 
about the hours, or wonder why there are no woman janitors on muds, or a 
fido which barks or growls or pees on the curb is much more alive than one 
which just sits there scavenging.
#
~
FIGHT_PROG
FIGHTPROG
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  fight_prog <NUMBER>

The argument is a percentage like in rand_prog.

NOTE: Useful for giving mobiles combat attitude.  It is checked every 
combat round when the mobile is fighting.  Can be used to cast spells, 
curse at the opponent, or whatever. Only the first successful one will 
be processed to save time.  Also, this means that the mobile wont get 
lucky and 1. curse, cast a fireball and 2. spit on the player, cast 
another fireball in the same pulse.
#
~
ATTACK_PROG
ATTACKPROG
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  attack_prog <NUMBER>

The argument is a percentage like in rand_prog.

NOTE: This is called whenever a mob attacks a player due to 
aggressive, or aggressive-align, or because the mob hates that 
player's race.  It is called _before_ actual combat begins and 
will not stop combat from happening unless the mob or player 
dies during the prog.  It's best used for taunting such as having 
the mobile say "For the sake of Crystal Castle, have at thee $$n!" 
or for being annoying and having the mob full heal itself right 
off the bat, etc.

NOTE: Useful for having a little more fun with mob attitude. 
#
~
HITPRCNT_PROG
HITPRCNTPROG
HITPRCNT
NONE
NONE
NONE
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  hitprcnt_prog <NUMBER>

The argument is a percentage.

NOTE: Is activated at each PULSE_VIOLENCE when the mobile is fighting. 
It checks to see if the hitpoints of the mobile are below the given 
percentage.  Multiple hitprcnt_progs should be listed in increasing 
order of percent since a 40% will always be activated before a 20% 
and, only the first successful hitprcnt trigger is performed.
#
~
GREET_PROG
GREETPROG
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  greet_prog <NUMBER>

A percentage argument.

NOTE: Whenever someone enters the room with the mobile, and the mobile 
saw the person enter, this is checked. Good for shopkeepers who want to 
welcome customers, or for pseudo-aggressive mobiles which need to 
discriminate on who they attack.

NOTE: Neither greet_prog or all_greet_prog are activated if the mobile 
is fighting.
#
~
ALL_GREET_PROG
ALLGREETPROG
ALLGREET
NONE
NONE
NONE
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  all_greet_prog <NUMBER>

A percentage argument.

NOTE: Like greet_prog, but it can be triggered even if the mobile didnt 
see the arrival (i.e. sneak, invis, etc). This prog is useful for faking 
teleport rooms (if your mobiles can transfer) or for creating impassable 
guardians.

NOTE: Neither greet_prog or all_greet_prog are activated if the mobile 
is fighting.

Or if it is asleep!
Good to know in case the mob in question loads or repops sleeping,
like rip van winkle for example.
#
~
ENTRY_PROG
ENTRYPROG
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  entry_prog <NUMBER>

A percentage argument.

NOTE: The opposite of a greet_prog. Whenver the mobile itself enters a
new room, this can be triggered.  Useful for looking around, or waving
or other things that real PCs do when they arrive at a crowded room.
Only the first successful one of these is done so the mobile doesnt
look stupid by repeating commands resulting from multiple MOBprograms.
#
~
GIVE_PROG
GIVEPROG
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  give_prog <ARGUMENT>

The argument is either the complete name of an object, or the word 'all'. 
A complete name is like: "sword shiny magic" vs. "sword". It is whatever 
is on the line of the object section following the VNUM.

NOTE: This is triggered whenever something is given to the mobile.  Best 
used for quests.  Since the first successful trigger is the only one of 
this type which is processed, having an "all" argument give_prog at the 
end of the MOBprogram list is essentially a default response.
#
~
BRIBE_PROG
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  bribe_prog <NUMBER>

The argument is any positive integer number.

NOTE: This trigger is activated whenever money is given to the mobile. 
If the amount given exceeds the number, then process the commands. Note 
again, that an argument of '1' would act as a default response.  It's a 
good idea to have the mob rid itself of this gold so the player can't 
just kill it and get the money back.
#
~
CATCH_PROG
CATCHPROG
CATCH
NONE
NONE
MPTHROW, VARSTAT
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  catch_prog <NUMBER>

The throw message number this catch is supposed to handle.

NOTE: There will not be any valid $$codes when this is called other than 
that of the mob performing it.  Use $$codes carefully.
#
~
DEATH_PROG
DEATHPROG
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  death_prog <NUMBER>

The argument is a percent once again.

NOTE: When the mobile dies, if the random percentage is less than 
the argument the mobile performs the MOBprogram commands rather 
than the usual death_cry sequence.  This is done before the corpse 
is made, so the commands can be considered the mobiles last gasp.  
It could perhaps destroy the items it was holding, or create some, 
or cast a spell on the killer and the room, or even goto a new 
location and die there (with a text message, the corpse would seem 
to vanish).  The position of the mobile is set to STANDING, and so 
it can do all the normal commands, without worrying about being 
DEAD.  However, even if the mobile restores itself to full hitpoints, 
it will still die. This is not a way to immortal mobiles. However, 
the last thing this mobile does could be to goto some vacant room, 
load a fresh version of itself, drop all its items, force the new 
mobile to get all the items and wear them, send the new mobile back 
to the character who killed it and force the new mobile to attack 
that character. Along with a text message which said the mobile 
restored itself, this might be a convincing effect. 
(Note that your kitten could turn into a dragon this way too).
#
~
ARAND_PROG
ARANDPROG
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  arand_prog <NUMBER>

The argument is a percentage.

NOTE: Works just like the rand_prog described above, except this 
prog will fire even if there are no PCs in the zone.
#
~
LOAD_PROG
LOADPROG
NONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  load_prog <NUMBER>

The argument is a percentage.

NOTE:  This prog will fire when the mob repops or is loaded.  The
primary use of this prog type is to have a mobile 'spell-up' when
it loads.
#
~
MPARGLIST
PROCEDIT ARGLIST
ARGLIST
NONE
NONE
ACT_PROG SPEECH_PROG
L: 103
E:
The 'arglist' field of the 'procedit' command is used to give an
argument to the trigger type that proceeds it.  The type of argument
required varies according to what type of trigger it is being used
for.  For instance, a speech_prog requires that the given argument
be something that a PC says, while the argument for a rand_prog will
be a percentage, e.g. 10.

Syntax:  procedit arglist <proc#> <argument>

         MPECHOAT      <victim> <text_string>
         MPECHOAROUND  <victim> <text_string>

Prints the text message to the mobiles room. The three 
options let you tailor the message to goto victims or to 
do things sneaky like having a merchant do: mpat guard 
mpechoat guard rescue_please. This coupled with a guard 
act_prog trigger on rescue_please to mpgoto PC and mpecho 
that the mob has arrived.  It is an affective way of quickly
bringing guards to the scene of an attack.

Loads the obj/mobile into the inven/room of the mobile. 
Items must have the TAKE flag (in wear flags) for the
mobile to receive it into their inventory.  This lets
a mobile distribute a quest item or load a key or something.

MPCOMMANDS MPJUNK
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  MPPURGE [argument]

Destroys the argument from the room of the mobile. Without
an argument the result is the cleansing of all NPC's and
items from the room with the exception of the mobile itself.
However, mppurge $$i will indeed purge the mobile, but it MUST
be the last command the mobile tries to do, otherwise the mud
cant reference the acting mobile trying to do the commands 
and bad things happen.

If the argument is an item in mobile's inventory, the item will poof.
But it is probably a better practice to use MPJUNK than MPPURGE
to poof items in mobiles own inventory.

Moves the mobile to the room/mobile/PC/object requested.
It makes no message of its departure or of its entrance, so 
these must be supplied with mpecho commands if they are 
desired.

MPCOMMANDS
L: 103

guard summoning, or corpse vanishing.

Syntax:  MPTRANSFER <victim> [dest]

Sends the victim to the destination or to the room of the 
mobile as a default. If the victim is "all" then all the 
characters in the room of the mobile are transferred to 
the destination.  Good for starting quests or things like 
that.  There is no message given to the player that it has 
been transferred and the player doesnt do a look at the 
new room unless the mob forces them to. 

Note: This cannot be used on immortals.
Note: This will effectively stop combat.
      So transfer away, and transfer back (using MPAT also)
      with no delay between transfers will appear to the
      players to simply be a cease of combat for no reason.

MPCOMMANDS
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  MPFORCE <victim> <command>

Forces the victim to do the designated command.  The 
victim is not told that they are forced, they just do 
the command so usually some mpecho message is nice.  
You can force players to remove belongings and give 
them to you, etc.  The player sees the normal command 
messages (such as removing the item and giving it away 
in the above example)  Again, if the victim is "all" 
then everyone in the mobiles room does the command. 

Note: This cannot be used on immortals.
      The immortal block also applies to mobs with levels
      that high.

Note: The victim will perform the action instantly, even
      if they are lagged by spells or whatever they might
      have been doing before the force.

MPCOMMANDS, MPSETTEMP, MPVARS, VARSTAT, CATCH
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  MPTHROW <victim (mob-nameIvnum)> <catch-num> <delay>

Throws a "message" to victim (who is specified by a name 
(poodle) or by the vnum of the mob it should go to) after 
the amount of delay time has expired.  The victim will 
always be a mob.  If the mob has a CATCH_PROG defined 
for that catch-num it will be executed at that time.

To throw a player name to another mob, you can:
MPTHROW <victim> <catch-num> <delay> <$$n>

Then, to call it on the catching mob, use $$v[throw]

Valid catch-num range is 1 to 50.  51 is invalid.

The data section of the THROW ($$n in the above syntax line)
may not include any spaces.  Therefore, anything after the
first space in the data section will be ignored.  This means
that after the first space in the data section makes a convenient
place to put comments.

For example:
MPTHROW 1234 1 3 true This part, after the word "true" can be a comment.
Note that the comment section should not contain any digits,
or bad things will happen.

Note also that the comment may contain a $, but if so, it should be
followed by a valid variable letters.  No spaces or invalid letters
after the $, or your prog will be broken.

MPSETTEMP
TEMP VARS
NONE
NONE
REVAMP
MPCOMMANDS, MPTHROW, MPVARS, VARSTAT
L: 103
E:
Syntax:  MPSETTEMP <victim> <variable name> <data>

Assigns a temporary variable to the mobile or to a PC.  
This is useful in quest situations, in which you want 
a mob to recognize a PC, but dont want to use simple 
fetch x and give to y quests.  For instance, instead 
of having Frederick bring a heart of a paladin to Lord 
Soth, you could have a mobile assign Frederick a temporary 
variable.  Lord Soth could then look for this temporary 
variable on anyone entering his room.

Should you need to target all players in a room (ex: death_prog),
you can use allpc for the victim.

To save variables (across boots, player logging in and out) use:
MPSETTEMP <victim> <variable name> <data> [save]

Example: MPSETTEMP $$n Moose-owner true
         (Sets the variable "Moose-owner" to "true")

Then to access it, the moose-salesman would:

if tempvar($$n[Moose-owner]) == true
  say You can never get enough moose, eh?
else
  say How abouts a moose for those lonely nights?
endif

In tempvar if tests, vars that are not initialized always return false.
When testing if the value of a var is equal to a string, this is fine,
it won't matter.
But if you want to test if a value is != a string, then the test will
return false, even though the variable was never set to the string
for which you want inequality.
So the test will return false, enough though your variable does NOT
equal the string when you are testing with != in tempvar.
Therefore, if you want to test with != in tempvar, you must set
variable to some other value at some point before your test will
get executed.

For accessing values outside of if-tests,
or inside any if test $B$4other than$R $Btempvar$R,
you will need to use alternate variable identifiers.
Here is the list: (taken from help MPVARIABLE)

v    is equal to $$i's temporary variable.
V    is equal to $$n's temporary variable.
w    is equal to $$t's temporary variable.
W    is equal to $$r's temporary variable.

$Btempvar()$R should use any of the usual $$i, $$n, $$t, $$r

Adding 1 of the above variables into the previous example will give us:

if tempvar($$n[Moose-owner]) == true
  say I see that it is $$V[Moose-owner] that
  say you already have a moose...
  say You can never get enough moose, eh?
endif

Thus in practice, we should see this:
The moose salesman says 'I see that it is true that'
The moose salesman says 'you already have a moose...'
The moose salesman says 'You can never get enough moose, eh?'
==================================================
==================================================

Comments in your code:
In the first line of this help,
the last section in the syntax is the data section.  
There may not be any spaces in the data section.
Therefore, anything after the first space in the
data section will be ignored.  This means that after
the first space in the data section makes a convenient
place to put comments.

For example:
MPSETTEMP $$i charmie $$n This part, after the "$$n" can be a comment.
==================================================

For throwing variables to mobs, using MPTHROW, the variable is now
stored in the variable "throw."  So, when you need to call that
variable, you have to call it with:

say Hi $$v[throw]

To create the "throw" you use:

MPOTHROW <object vnum> <catch #> <delay> <player name>

MPDAMAGE

MPCOMMANDS MPECHODAMAGE
L: 103
E:
Does damage without a message to <victim> or to everything, or to PC's only.
 
In the syntax listing, we use the following conventions:
<required>
[optional]
[optional ... ] = You may include this option multiple times.
slashes         = either/or
 
Basic  Syntax:  MPDAMAGE <target> <[dam-details ... ] dam-details>
 
Target Syntax:  target = <victim-name/all/allpc>
             of course,  "victim-name" may be $$n, $$f, etc.
             if target = "all", that will include mobs and PC's.
             if target = "allpc", that will be PC's only.
 
Damage Syntax: 
     dam-details       = <damroll>[%][damage-bonus[%]] <damtype> <point-type>
     $B$4Note:$0 In the Basic Syntax above, you may
           have multiple instances of dam-details$R
         
     <damroll>         = A standard damage roll,i.e. XdY, 5d10, 2d4
     <damage-bonus>    = Same as +damage in your scorebox.
                       This adds additional damage on top of the damroll.
     [%]               = Percentage of the victims CURRENT points.
                       % is optional for both damroll and damage-bonus.
     <dam-type>        = <any of 14 keywords listed below>
     <point-type>      = <hitpoints/mana/move/ki>
     $B$4Note:$0 In your last instance of dam-details, point-type is optional.
           When omitting point-type, default is "$4hitpoints$0".$R
 
Following is more clarification (hopefully) of the above syntax details.
 
The <damroll> must be a standard damroll,i.e. XdY, 5d10, 2d4.
Use d1 for a non-random amount, since 100d1 will always do 100 damage.
Or alternatively, use 0d0+100 to get the same 100 damage total.
 
% is optional after the damroll.  If % is used, it will make the
damage a percentage of the victims CURRENT (not maximum) points.
 
If you use the optional damage-bonus, you may also optionally
include % after the damage-bonus as well.  Effect is the same
as with damroll.
 
Be careful with "%".  Obviously, it can drastically change the results.
Nothing bad happens (to the game anyway) if total damage in percentage
format is greater than 100%.  Will not crash the game, etc...
 
The <damtype> is what "type" of damage it is.
Use one of the following keywords for the damage type:
 
  "magic",
  "charm",
  "fire",
  "energy",
  "acid",
  "poison",
  "sleep",
  "cold",
  "para",
  "ki",
  "song",
  "physicalmagic",
  "water",
  "undefined"
 
The <point-type> is which stat will take the damage.
Use one of the following keywords for the point type:
 
  "hitpoints",
  "mana",
  "move",
  "ki"
Omitting the point type will default to hitpoints.
$B$4Note:$0 Omitting the point type is only allowed
      in the last instance of your dam-details.$R
 
Examples:
 
>Mpdamage Urizen 50d1% acid hitpoints
>emote lets out a horrible fart burning Urizen with the fumes!
This will deal 50% of Urizen's CURRENT hitpoints damage to him.
This is before it is modified by sanc and whatever.
 
>emote lets out a horrible fart injuring everyone in the room!
>MPDAMAGE all 2d5 acid
 
>emote lets out a horrible fart and LIGHTS it with a match!
>MPDAMAGE all 2d5 acid hitpoints 2d5 fire
$B$4Note:$0 Previous and next are equivelent:$R
>MPDAMAGE all 2d5 acid hitpoints 2d5 fire hitpoints
 
>emote lets out a horrible fart and LIGHTS it with a match!
>MPDAMAGE all 2d4%+3% acid hitpoints 2d15+2% fire hitpoints 10d9%+50 fire move
 
The only limitation on how many instances of the dam-details section
you may have is based on the limit of line length in the editor.
Which I dunno what that limit is.
If you want several instances, just try it.
 
Note:  You cannot damage immortals with this command.
 
Note: Make sure you do the "message" for the damage first.
Otherwise if it kills someone, everyone will see the:
"has been KILLED!!"  message before they see the emote.

syntax:  if  keyword($$x)   <=> (int)  

Where x is one of the variables listed in help mpvariable, <=> is
less than, greater than, equal to, etc...  int is an integer.

PRIZE ARENA
PRIZEARENA
NONE
NONE
NONE
PRIZE LIST
L: 1
E:
On Dark Castle, Immortals may sometimes run 'prize arenas'.  As the name
implies, the winner of the arena will win a prize of the Immortal's
choosing.  The basic and fundamental concept behind these arenas are for
players to engage in one-on-one combat, with the last player standing
being designated as the winner.  While some Immortals may have different
sets of rules, the following serves as the basic set:
 
1) No grouping.
2) No spelling each other up.
3) No joining.
   a. The subset of this rule is that if you walk into a room and your
      KOS goes off on someone who is already fighting, it STILL COUNTS
      as a "join" and can and will result in a disqualification at the
      discretion of the immortal who is running the prize arena.
4) No following/stalking.
5) The spirit of these rules is obvious.  Attempts to circumvent the
   premise of "solo" combat that these rules are based on will result
   in disqualification at the arena creator's discretion.
6) Any and all complaints over gossip about people breaking the rules
   of the prize arena will be summarily ignored.  If someone is breaking
   the rules, the proper course of action is to inform the Immortal
   running the arena of whats going on.
7) Any additional rules specified by the Immortal running the arena.

SPELL CRAFT
SPELLCRAFT
NONE
NONE
QUEST SKILLS, MAGE, SPELLS, SKILL QUEST
L: 1
E:
Through continuous study and the extensive use of magicks,
the truly gifted wizard is able to attain the highest levels
of his profession.  This mastery, amongst his or her fellow
arch-magi, is referred to as "Spellcraft".  Expertise in this
ability provides the magic user with two primary affects and
several secondary abilities.
 
The powers that the truly gifted wizard will gain from a mastery
of spellcraft is the ability to enhance certain elements of some
spells.  These enhancements can ONLY be attained and improved
upon if the mage has achieved the proper level of skill in
"Spellcraft" and a level of "$BVery Good$R" or higher in the specific
spell.  As well, should the mage's ability in any of the spells
listed below dip BELOW a level of "$BVery Good$R", they will lose
any special abilities until such time as they improve the spell
to "$BVery Good$R" or higher again.
(Meaning, you must have "$BVery Good$R" or higher in each of the
skills listed to be able to advance to the appropriate stage
in your Spellcraft ability.  For example, to learn Spellcraft
past the initial "Magic Missile" stage, you need a "$BVery Good$R"
or higher in magic missile to begin improving.  If your ability
in any spell dips below "$BVery Good$R" you lose special powers
until you get it back to that level or higher again.)
 
Know further that Spellcraft cannot be improved through all of the
traditional means of practice, but rather by those outlined below,
and by optionally using practice sessions up to average as well.
 
$Ba)$R When Spellcraft is learned to a level of "horrible", the mage
gains the ability to summon forth an additional Magic Missile
when casting this spell.  As well, the mage will find the speed
at which he can summon this missiles is decreased to once per
round of combat.
Note that at this stage only the casting of "Magic Missile" or
usage of practice sessions can improve the mage's "Spellcraft" Skill.
 
$Bb)$R  When Spellcraft is learned to a level of "meager", the mage gains
the ability to target not one, but *two* individual targets with
his or her "Burning Hands" spell.  This action can be performed by:
cast 'burning hands' <target 1> <target 2>
Note that at this stage only the usage of practice sessions or casting
of "Burning Hands" with the double targeting feature can improve the
mage's "Spellcraft" Skill.
 
$Bc)$R When Spellcraft is learned to a level of "Poor" the archmage
will find that their "Lightning Bolt" spell is able to target
foes in rooms immediately adjacent to their person.  This affect
will not, alas penetrate an anti-magic aura or room the gods
have deemed "safe".  This action can be performed by:
cast 'lightning bolt' target direction
Note that at this stage only the usage of practice sessions or casting
of "Lightning Bolt" from a distance can improve the mage's "Spellcraft"
skill.
 
$Bd)$R When Spellcraft is learned to a level of "Decent" the wizard
will find that their "Chill Touch" ability will temporarily drain
a small amount of Strength (STR) and Dexterity (DEX) from their
opponent in addition to the damage it inflicts.
Note that at this stage only the casting of "Chill Touch" or
usage of practice sessions can improve the mage's "Spellcraft" Skill.
 
$Be)$R When Spellcraft is learned to a level of "Average" the magus
will find that their "Fireball" spell can be conjured at the much
improved rate of once per combat round.
Note that at this stage only the casting of "Fireball" or
usage of practice sessions can improve the mage's "Spellcraft" Skill.
 
$Bf)$R When Spellcraft is learned to a level of "Fair" the mage will
find that their ability to summon forth a "Meteor Swarm" has the
additional affect of occasionally knocking their opponent off
their feet.  This ability causes no further delay to their foe
beyond the fact that they will need to "stand" to continue
special combat action.
Note that at this stage only the casting of "Meteor Swarm"
can improve the mage's "Spellcraft" Skill.
 
$Bg)$R When Spellcraft is learned to a level of "Good" the sorcerer
will find that their talents that allow them to "Paralyze" an
opponent will last an addional tick or round longer.
Note that at this stage only the casting of "Paralyze"
can improve the mage's "Spellcraft" skill.
 
$Bh)$R When Spellcraft is learned to a level of "Very Good" the archmage
will find that their casting of "Create Golem" will frequently
work without consuming all of the required components.
Note that at this stage only the casting of "Create Golem"
can improve the mage's "Spellcraft" skill.
 
$Bi)$R When Spellcraft is learned to a level of "Excellent" the archmage
will find that their powerful summoned Golems will gain a variety
of affects and magicks to employ against their opponents.
Note that at this stage only the casting of "Hellstream"
can improve the mage's "Spellcraft" skill.
 
$Bj)$R When Spellcraft is learned to a level of "Masterful" the powerful
archmage will find that their ability to open a "Solar Gate"
has improved and gained the additional affect of occasionally
blinding those unwary enough to be caught in its range.
Note that at this stage only the casting of "Solar Gate"
can improve the mage's "Spellcraft" skill.
 
Though an arduous and lengthy quest is required to attain this
skill, as well as many hours of study and improvement, the
rewards, as any archmage can see, are well worth the time invested.

E:
A "SUICIDE" occurs when a player is slain as a result of self-inflicted
damage to their person.  There are several ways in which this can occur
including: a reflected spell, a self directed damaging scroll, or via
ingesting a potion that causes damage resulting in death.

A suicide generally appears on the "INFO" channel as:
<player> just committed SUICIDE!

Additionally, typing the "SUICIDE" command will result in your
character doing just that, committing suicide.  This is extremely useful
for those players who have just got tired of being alive.

The "suicide" command will not work in a safe room or with a thief flag.
It will result in a pkill for its actual effect.

Syntax:  suicide

L: 1
E:
The national hero of Meatballsia or, as it is sometimes referred, Sweden.

Dolph is best known for his "wide body" of excellent "acting" work and
rippling muscles.  His svelt frame, haircut you can set your watch by,
and piercingly vacant blue eyes epitomize the very essence of what every
Meatballsian seeks to achieve in life.

His recent migration to the United States has caused a great deal
of despair among the population of Meatballsia.  As such, he has
been immortalized in the song and verse of legends:

$B$1Sir Sweden oh Sweden, how great thou art Sir Sweden.$R
$B$5How long and lovely art thou supermodels.$R
$B$1How svelt and gay thy men.$R
$B$5How delicious and sweet thy meatballs$R
$B$1Not to love them would be a sin.$R

$B$1How sturdy and inexpensive thy furniture.$R
$B$5How fine are thou discos, how melodious thy ABBA tunes.$R
$B$1But most of all it is thy most loyal servant Dolph,
$B$5That sends thy people over the moon!$R
              - Excerpt from "Oh Meatballsia" circa 1992

DAMDICE
DAMAGE DICE

DAMAGE ROLL
DAM ROLL
DAMAGE, HIT ROLL, COMBAT, SKILLS, CLASSES, EQUIPMENT
L: 1
E:
Spells, weapons, mobs, and most damaging effects in the game not only
have a +damage roll indicating how much additional damage they do above
their basic damage amount, but also a "damage dice" roll that decides
how much basic damage is dealt before any bonuses.

This damage amount is indicated by a XdY amount where X is the number
of times a virtial die is rolled, and Y is the size of that virtual
die.  For example:

A damage dice roll of 5d6 would mean five six-sided dice are being rolled
to decide basic damage on an effect.  This means the damage each time
could me anywhere from 5 (all 6 dice roll 1s) to 30 (all 6 dice roll 5s).

The closer the 2 numbers are together, the better the average damage
is likely to be.  This means that a 1d20 roll is much less likely to
deliver fairly consistent damage than a 4d5 damage roll.

ZEDIT, ZEDIT EQ, ZEDIT DIRS, ZEDIT TYPE
L: 103
E:
When editing zonefiles, "if" commands are an important part of the
setup and command structure.

The "zedit if" structure is what determines the conditions upon which
a mob, object, or other zonefile specified event will load or occurr.

The syntax for setting the "if" command is as follows:
   $Bzedit edit <line #> if <if #>$R

When you select your "if #" an output line will indicate what kind of
"if" you have selected.  For example:

Builder enters:   $Bzedit edit 23 if 1$R
Output line is:  If flag for command 23 changed to 1 ($B$2OnTrue$R).

There are 10 types of "if" commands.  The "if #", name, and use for
each are listed below:

  $Rzedit edit <line #> if <if #>$R
  (if #s listed below)

if 0 = (always) - command will always occurr each reboot and repop.
if 1 = ($B$2ontrue$R) - command will occurr if the previous line was true.
                  (meaning if the previous command DID happen)
if 2 = ($B$4onfalse$R)- command will occurr if the previous line was false.
                  (meaning if the previous command DID NOT happen)
if 3 = ($B$5onboot$R) - command will only occurr following a reboot.
if 4 = ($B$2Ls$1Mb$2Tr$R) - Last Mob True - command will occurr if the
                  closest previous "load mob" line DID load a mob.
if 5 = ($B$4Ls$1Mb$4FL$R) - Last Mob False - command will occurr if the
                  closest previous "load mob" line DID NOT load a mob.
if 6 = ($B$2Ls$7Ob$2Tr$R) - Last Obj True - command will occurr if the
                  closest previous "load object" line DID load an obj.
if 7 = ($B$4Ls$7Ob$4Fl$R) - Last Obj False - command will occurr if the
                  closest previous "load object" line DID NOT load an obj.
if 8 = ($B$2Ls$R%%$2$BTr$R) - Last % True - command will occurr if the
                  closest previous "load %" line was true (successful).
                  (meaning: if a 10 in 100 chance DID occurr)
if 9 = ($B$4Ls$R%%$4$BFl$R) - Last % False - command will occurr if the
                  closest previous "load %" line was false (unsuccessful).
                  (meaning: if a 10 in 100 chance DID NOT occurr)

Any "if" commands that are 10 and over simply repeat the previously
listed ones.  Do not use anything over 9 as it can cause errors in
zonefile operation.

If you still have any questions about this be sure to contact your
supervisor Imm or an Imp.

$B$0A weathered adventurer wanders towards you with a friendly smile and says:$R

"Ah my young friend, so you are looking for a place to test your skill and
bloody your blade?  Perhaps you are in need of some equipment or a new weapon?
Allow me to recommend the quiet town of Newtonia south-west of Sorpigal."

"To find your way there from the Albatross Tavern, you must travel:
     $B$7s, 7w, 2s, e, s, e, 2s, w, s$R."

"Whilst traveling along that route you may happen to encounter the Skill 
Master who frequents the area.  Be sure to stop and speak with him as he can
teach you a few skills that you will be unable to learn anywhere else.  The 
skills learned from him will be essential to your continued survival.  Like 
all other skills on Dark Castle, they will increase as you use them."

"The Skill Master teaches: '$B$7CONSIDER$R', '$B$7RELEASE$R', '$B$7SWITCH$R', and '$B$7SCAN$R'."

"Once you arrive in Newtonia, you will find a variety of townsfolk to interact
with, or slay if you prefer.  "$2Mossy$R" equipment can be found on most of the
residents of the town.  This is great equipment for one who is just setting out
on a life of adventure!  Of particular note are the small spears carried by the
guards of the city.  These can make nice weapons for a fledgling explorer and
fighter, or even a rogue seeking to stab foes."

"The Newtonians are generally a peace loving people and most are quick to flee
a fight that is not going their way.  Be wary when chasing any who have fled
from you, however, as they may attack you on sight in an attempt to exact a
measure of revenge!  Whenever possible, it may be prudent to do your killing
behind a closed door to prevent your foe from running."

"The Newtonian shopkeeper in town offers several useful items for sale.  If you 
find yourself close to death, consider trying one of his $2mossy$R lozenges. They
work wonders for the wounded.  Before attacking the shopkeeper, or any citizen
of Newtonia, be sure to $B$7CONSIDER$R them carefully.  This will give you a
better estimation of their abilities and even more details as your 'consider'
skill (learned from the Skill Master) improves."

"At the end of a cobblestone road you will find the city fountain.  This is 
very useful for the adventurer who forgot to stop at the bakery for food or
failed to fill their waterskin before leaving Sorpigal."

"In the western part of Newtonia you will find the Newtonian chapel.  If you
visit the priest here he may offer you a blessing.  Be $B$7very$R careful when 
exploring the chapel as it is rumored that spirits of slain Newtonians wander 
the halls.  They have the ability to magically hide themselves from sight and 
they do NOT like the living.  You have been warned."

$B$0Wrapping up his tale, the adventurer takes a long pull from his buffalo
waterskin and says...$R

"Well there young'un, enjoy your time in Newtonia and give my best to Gno."

$B$0At that, he wanders off no doubt looking for more "water" to drink.$R

$B$0A small crumpled letter has somehow found its way into your journal...$R

Catastrophi,

I took your recommendation and shacked up in Sorpigal for a while. It's
fairly isolated, and nobody asks too many questions. It got a little
boring just butchering all their little animals at night, so I started
exploring. I ran across a church Sexton, near the fountain on the South
side of town. I pretended to be interested in his wretched little deity
long enough to notice he was carrying a key. A little sleight of hand
and I was off to visit the nearby graveyard.

After a short bout of vandalism, I started digging up the gravesites,
hoping to find some valuables. Don't ask me why you'd bury perfectly
good gems with an old wrinkly body... Especially in a town like this
where they pay top dollar. Anyway, I was waist deep in one of the old
tombs when I heard some scuffling, moaning sounds coming from all
directions. I suppose I should have stopped to ask myself why they'd
keep the graveyard locked up. Apparently, it's chock full of undead.

I started stabbing at every skeleton and lumbering corpse between me
and the entrance, but they didn't even slow down. I finally dropped my
daggers and ran, using my fists and an old rusty sword to keep them at
bay. I bloodied them up pretty good and got out with some decent loot,
but I'm sure there's more to be found there.

Maybe we can go check it out when you get here. I saw an old chapel that
looks promising, but there was a guy hanging around in there, singing
and lighting candles. Rumor has it that the chapel has an entrance
to some ancient catacombs, but it's not the kind of place I'd want to go
alone. Supposed to be some pretty scary stuff down there.

Anyway, I'll be at the tavern spending our hard-earned gold. Don't
take too long getting here, or there might not be much left to split.
May the blood of your enemies flow deep, and their cries echo long
into the night.

"The servants will be the easiest prey and the guards slightly more
difficult.  Be careful however, if you are attempting to cross blades
with the noble King or Queen.  Merlin himself resides in retirement at
the top of the tower in the northeastern part of the castle.  He, on 
occasion, will be wearing a glass earring which is a very useful item
for one of limited experience.  Bringing a group of friends along for
help when facing Merlin for the first time might be a good idea as his
powers are not to be taken lightly."
  
"There are rumors of entrances to other dimensions in the castle as well! 
Higher level characters might come seeking a way to these dimensions
and not all of them will be friendly.  Using the $B$7WHERE$R command on
occasion may alert you to the presence of other adventurers in the area.
This perhaps can give you time to beat a hasty retreat if necessary."

E:
Theives are neither particularly known for honesty or sense
of fair play.  These traits extend to combat where they have
developed a "unique" set of skills that are not widely
regarded as "honourable".
 
In combat, via use of their agility and stealth, thieves have
the ability to land a quick, jabbing strike to their opponent's
head with the hilt of any kind of weapon.  This blow, if 
effected properly, will result in their victim being dazed for
a period of time.
 
The result of this dazed condition is to briefly give the thief
an upper hand in combat and even occasionally causes their
opponent's abilities to fail or strike the wrong target!
 
In addition, should the thief (alone, or with his associates)
be attacking a *single* target that is in such a dazed state,
the thief may attempt to $BCIRCLE$R behind his target and land
a pair of attacks from behind.
 
As a stunning blow of this nature requires a high level of
concentration and uses the traditionally non-lethal part of a
weapon, the thief will need to wait a brief period between uses
of the ability as he refocuses and checks to ensure his weapon
is intact.

E:
Through the intensive study of their natural surroundings, druids gain
the ability to reduce the amount of movement points that different sectors
require. To increase the skill automatically, the druid must move about
in the appropriate kind of sector until they have sufficiently improved
their skill.  Then, the skill will improve only as the druid moves about
the next required sector.

Each sector type's "learning curve" is about 10 "skill points" (see $Bhelp PRAC$R)
in duration.  The order of sectors that the druid may improve their movement
in are as follows:
Field, Forest, Beach, Desert, Tundra, Swimming (water),
Hills, Arctic, Mountains, and Underwater.

Once the druid has improved to the maximum of a particular sector type,
he or she can only advance their ability by moving about the next type in the order.

Once a player reaches a certain level (usually 30th) they will, depending
upon their class, be able to become more efficient in the use of specific
weapons. These are listed as the skills of: whipping, crushing, piercing,
slashing, bludgeoning, stinging, and hand to hand (for monks).
Improvement in these areas will lead to a greater ability to hit ones
opponent as well as increased damage done by each successful hit.
  
In order to improve in these areas, one may practice as they do normal
skills, or they can wield a weapon of this type and autoimprove through

        hedit <id#> level <value>
        hedit save

The hedit command allows you to add, modify or save helpfile entries.

Lets say you wanted to add a new helpfile about the command EAT, that anyone
level 1 or higher can read. It should also point to two related helpfile
entries, namely SIP and TASTE. Users should be able to find this helpfile
entry with the keywords: EAT, DRINK, FOOD or WATER. To do this you would
type the following:

> hedit new eat
Help entry #754 added with keyword 'EAT'.
> hedit 754 entry
Write your help entry and stay within the line.  (/s saves /h for help)
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
From time to time you may notice that your character is...
...
/s
Ok.
> hedit 754 key 2 drink
> hedit 754 key 3 food
> hedit 754 key 4 water
> hedit 754 related sip, taste
> help eat
> hedit 754 level 1
> hedit save
Saved.

You should always confirm your helpfile entry is as you intended it (help eat)
before setting its level to 1 (hedit 754 level 1) or saving it (hedit save).
Once the helpfile entry's level has been set to level 1 any mortal can view it.

In addition, all helpfiles meant for mortal eyes must be approved by
Apocalypse first, before setting the helpfile level to 1. Helpfiles meant
for immortal eyes should be set to level 102 or higher, depending on the
level of the command being written about.

==========================================================================
We are using "available" as a keyword for helpfiles that are currently
empty and may be used as new slots before making a new helpfile.

Type: "hindex empty" to see which index numbers are currently unused.

If you accidently create a new help and have nothing to put in it,
or if an existing help should be deleted (perhaps it is a copy of
another?) then please set the keywords to be the same as any of the
others that are also available.
The point of this is to recycle existing unused index numbers before
making new ones.

MXP
EXTENSION PROTOCOL
NONE
NONE
NONE
CLIENT
L: 1
E:
Overview of MXP:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Somewhere in the history of mudding, a protocol was created
which would allow the mudding experience to be enhanced.

MXP is short for "Mud eXtension Protocol"

MXP looks similar at first glance to html tags, in the sense that tags
are enclosed in pointy brackets ( such as < and > ), tags must be in
pairs, and the second tag in a pair should have a slash inside the
pointy brackets ( such as </color> ).

MXP is different from html in sense that there are various tags
supported which are not part of html, and pairs of tags must occur
on the same line coming from the mud, or they will be ignored.
When properly used, and intentionally enabled, MXP may serve well
to enhance the mudding experience.

With this in mind, Zugg (author of zMud) enabled MXP in his zMud
client, as a feature which might be enjoyed by users of his client.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Caveats of MXP:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, in zMud it would seem that the default setting for MXP is "ON",
at least in some versions of the client.  Maybe not in all versions,
even if a specific version enables it.

Unfortunatly, it would also seem that the full potential of MXP is not
readily apparent to neophite users of zMud, even if one were to read
any obvious READ ME files that might come with zMud.  It is also not
clear that MXP is enabled by default.

That is the reason for this help topic, so that you will become aware of
the full potential of having MXP enabled (including ways that other
people might use the feature to their advantage).

Various tags are supported by MXP.  Two of them are the color tag, and
the font tag.  By using either, you may change the color or font that is
shown to you within your client.  This also means that others may cause
various lines that you might see to change color or font, even if you
did not expect it.

<color red>For example, this line might appear to be red,</color>
if you are using zMud with MXP enabled.

That effect was achieved by having this tag: <color red>
at the beginning of the line, and having this tag: </color>
at the end of the line.  The tags are ignored by your client in the
previous 2 lines because the tags are not both on the same line as
each other.

So if you always wanted to see your name in red, you might do this:
name <color red>%</color>
(That is, have the % inside a pair of color tags, specifying red.)
Anyone without MXP enabled would see the literal tags around your
name, and while this isn't really annoying, it does make you look silly.

If you follow this thinking through to it's logical end, you should
realize that any line with a color tag set to the same color as your
background color will appear to be blank.

So for example, if you have MXP enabled and you have black set as your
background color, and someone else has their name set to black with:
<color black> before their name, and with:
</color> on the same line but after their name, then their name will
appear to be invisible whenever you see it.

The font tag may also be used to change which font is used to render the
text coming from the mud.  Since some fonts do not render the alphabet
as readable characters, this may also be used to have a name appear to
you to be garbled, and unreadable.

By now, based on the lines above with the red color tag, you should know
if you have MXP enabled in your zMud client (or in any other client that
might enable MXP).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Procedure for turning off MXP in zMud:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Across the top of your zMud screen there are a series of buttons.
    Find the box with a checkmark called prefs.  Click it.
2)  On the left side of the window that opens are a list of things you
    can change, starting with "General"; scroll that window down to MXP.
3)  Click "MXP" (not "MXP General" which is right below it).
4)  On the right side will be several check boxes.
    The top-left box is titled "Enable MXP".  Find it.
5)  Click the checkbox next to it so it becomes empty.
6)  Close the window

Proceed with mudding, safe from treacherous color and font changers.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If anyone notices that another client besides zMud also enables MXP,
please bring this to the attention of a god (preferably the god
assigned to maintain the helpfiles) and they will add the procedure
here for turning off MXP in that client, if you tell them the procedure.

Builders, this help file is for you.

If your new area will have any special procedures or mob programs,
Try to get the mob programming guy involved early.  As soon as possible.
Realistically, the mob programmer can probably start working on things
as soon as you know vnum's of your mobs.
-
Even if you cant know your vnum's for awhile, it can be helpful to let
the guy know what you will need, so (s)he can start thinking on things
and get some logic worked out in advance of making actual programs.

L: 1
E:
The SPELL_DAMAGE ability is the caster's equivalent to +DAMAGE.
 
For each point of SPELL_DAMAGE any caster has, their offensive magics
will deal an additional 1 point of damage. (Much like +DAMAGE increases the
damage of each melee blow by 1.)
 
Items with any significant amount of the SPELL_DAMAGE effect are rarely, if
ever, accompanied by signficant melee +DAMAGE.
 
Note that this bonus will also affect spells that are fired from weapons.
 
The spells: Magic Missile, Bee Sting, and Blue Bird have special cases where
only the first spell fired by these spells will receive the bonus (doh!).

Also, the spirit is bound to the land in which it lived, and may
not leave it.

Mountain King's Charge

Though dwarves are known to make particularly poor magic-users, they're also 
known for their love of song and festivity.  Every now and then a dwarf will 
find her voice empowered with bardic magic.  Though some of the more elaborate 
songs are lost on dwarves, this rousing battle song is a heart-felt favorite 
among all the clans.

When used, a bard can incite his or her group into a frenzy, allowing all his 
or her allies to hit for extra damage in combat.  It's said particularly masterful 
war bards are able to link other effects into their rousing cries, turning even 
the most timid healer into a ferocious battlerager.

L: 1
E:
This spell leeches the life force out of all beings in the room.  The
lost hit points will be added to your hit points. Of course, a side effect
is that all the mobs in the room will now call for your head and attack
you.

This life force is one of the most basic forces of energy there is.
The more there is of it, the more resistance there is to having it
sucked out of you.

When more than one being is together in the same place, their life
forces combine to make each of them more resistant to having the
life force sucked out of them.  The more beings that are together
in the same place, the more they are resistant to sucking.

Due to the nature of one life force trying to suck another, these
life forces are in opposition.  So the life force of the one doing
the sucking does not add to the life force of the ones being sucked.
However, companions of the sucker can not keep their own life force
from adding to the life force of the victims.

Although the sucker will never actually suck life from his companions,
the companions will still help make the victims more resistant to the
sucking.  They can't help it, their life force is one of the most basic
energy forms known.

CLAN CHAOS

CC SEASON
CLANCHAOS
RESULTS, ARENA, PRIZE ARENA, CLAN
L: 1
E:
Clan Chaos is the official Dark Castle sporting event of champions!

During Clan Chaos or CC season, a series of arenas are held with rules that
are pre-determined and announced by the presiding Immortal.

Generally speaking each clan is allowed to form a group of a specific number
of clan members and is then transferred into a remote corner of the arena by
the CC Immortal.  Note that there are several different arenas that can be
used for the event.  Sometimes a "max hit-point cap" per group will be announced.

Once in the arena it is imperative that the clan stay IN THE SAME ROOM
and NOT MOVE until the "go" signal is given by the presiding Immortal.
After the start of the chaos is indicated, clans may stay together or
divide as they see fit.  Note that when the arena closes, this is the
official "go" signal.  Even if the presiding immortal bellows/thunders
"go" seconds later, the chaos has already started.

Note that you may NOT group with members of any other clan OR join ANY other
clan in combat.  If you are caught in the same room as another clan and not
fighting, you risk being disqualified.  This also applies for moving or acting
before the "go" signal is given.

Further clarification on what consitutes "helping" or "joining" other clans
can be found in the "help prize arena" helpfile.  What goes for single players
in that helpfile essentially goes for groups and clans in Clan Chaos.

Any other questions can be directed to the Immortal running the clan chaos.
Note that the Immortal running the Clan Chaos' decisions are FINAL and
whining or further complaining after a decision has been finalized will only
result in disqualification in the current or future CC events.

Scoring is tracked and posted shortly after the chaos ends by the presiding
immortal.  Scores will track and carry over through the season after which
the presiding Immortal may either declare a winner or hold a series of
"playoffs" at their discretion and as announced during the season.

Further questions can be directed to the Clan Chaos presiding Immortal.

such as song or dance, and more specialized and martial arts.
 
To commemorate the occasion this year, the guild has commissioned, through
the various master bards and monks found throughout the realms, a set of
clothing designed to protect the wearer from those who might be less
appreciative of the many forms of artisitic expression.
 
To this end, the masters of their craft created what they are calling:
$B"the Celebrant's Defenses"$R
These garments have been specially designed for those bards or monks who
are on the path, but have not yet reached, artistic mastery.
 
I encourage you to take part in the annual festival and perhaps find some of these
garments for yourself as many of the monks and bards who attended are now utilizing
these items throughout the realms.

Throughout the ages, skill in martial arts has developed and been passed down

The result of this diversity is both a perfection of form and action in many
varieties of martial arts.  Such mastery has been attained by monks who
travel the realms of Dark Castle.

To this end, a set of equipment has been designed for such master monks to
assist them in their combative artistry and raise them to heights as yet

The legend of the Mother of all Dragons (MOAD for short) has been told
through generations in whispered stories to children and in boastful tales

seen or witnessed the fury of this beast of legend, let alone survived to
tell the tale.

Should a group of brave adventurers successfully find and slay this terrible
and mighty beast, a hoard of ages and countless treasures is sure to be
theirs.  It is even said that the MOAD crafts some of the skins and bodies
of her victims into items of great magical power.

Should such adventurers manage to defeat her a sufficient number of times
as to acquire a set of such trophies, extraordinary power will surely follow.

L: 1
E:
There are a variety of prizes that the Immortals give to players for
many reasons.  These can include (but are not restricted to):
PRIZE ARENAS, TRIVIA, QUESTS, reporting a BUG, helping a NEWBIE,
and many others. 
  
Many of the senior immortal staff have their own personal "tokens"
that give a reward as listed in "help TOKEN".  Additionally, BROWNIES
and CLAN VOUCHERS can also be acquired as outlined in their helpfile.
 
Other smaller prizes (often given out in multiples) are listed below:
 
1) a $B$1deep blue$R potion - a powerful healing potion
(much like the ones sold at the Meta Physician)
2) a $4deep red$R vial - a powerful mana recovery potion
(much like the ones sold at the Meta Physician)
 
3) a $Bbright white$R elixir - a sanctuary, bless, PFE potion
4) a glowing $B$6neon$R pill - a resist fire, cold, & energy potion
5) a loudly humming scroll - a teleport scroll
 
6) Illusionary eq including: Helm, Boots, Bands, Plate, and Club
   - very powerful items that disappear with the next reboot or logout.
 
7) a $B$4hot$R potato - a fun little toy that is activated via
   "push potatobutton" and will explode after a random amount of time.
   It can be only given to otherplayers after the button has been pushed,
   thus making for a fun time for all. ;)
 
8) a mystical $B$5golden brick$R - while not a reward in and of itself,
   these are often hidden about the world on various mobs (sometimes
   with clues and often without).  Should you find one and loot it off
   the mob it was found on, it will randomly turn into an item from a
   pre-determined list...this may be very good, or very useless. ;)
 
9) a $BClan Rewards Voucher$R - can be redeemed for 250 platinum worth
   of clan costs towards a new clan purchase, a clan hall, hall
   upgrades, or any other cost associated with clans.
 
There are many other prizes available at the discretion of the Immortals
including things like $4flaming chickens$R, Mardis Gras beads, and
many more!  Some are only temporary, some are on an ongoing basis.
Good luck!

CLANAREA CLAIM

CLAN AREAS, CLANAREA LIST, CLANAREA CHALLENGE
L: 1
E:
The "clanarea claim" command is the primary command for clan area abilities.
It allows a member of your clan who has the proper rights to claim an area on
behalf of your clan.  Once claimed, any gold taken from creatures in this area
that is not by members of your own clan will be subject to a 10% bounty.

This bounty accrues in an account within the area and must be collected
from time to time via the "CLANAREA COLLECT" command or your clan risks losing it.

You MUST be IN the zone itself to claim it and your clan can claim one zone per
member that is online.  If a member logs out, thus causing the number of claimed
areas to exceed online members, a random area is lost after 30 seconds (to allow
for switching to your alternate characters, etc...).  This can be avoided via
the "CLANAREA YIELD" command.

You will see both a global and clan message when an area is claimed by a member
of your clan.  You will see a global message when another clan claims an area.

ALL claims are reset each reboot.

To see what areas have been claimed by your clan use the "CLANAREA LIST" command.
Additionally, you can only claim ONE area PER CONNECTION.  This means players with
multiple or routered connections cannot claim more than 1 area between them.
There is also extra code in place to supervise multiplaying and attempts to
circumvent the intent of the clan areas system.

If you are in an area that is unclaimed and wish to claim it for your clan you
merely enter "clanarea claim" and it will be claimed (assuming your clan's max
has not been reached) for your clan.  Certain areas cannot be claimed (town for
example) and you cannot claim an area that another clan has already claimed.

If you wish to remove the claim of another clan and take an area for your own
you should utilize the "CLANAREA CHALLENGE" command.

Further details are outlined in "help CLAN AREAS".

CLANAREA CHALLENGE

CLAN AREAS, CLANAREA CLAIM, CLANAREA YIELD
L: 1
E:
Clans can challenge each other's claim on an area via the "clanarea challenge" command.
($BNOTE:$R Un-clanned players also read the note at the bottom of this file.)
 
Bounties will continue to accrue during a challenge, however, no bounties may be
collected until the challenge is over.  The winning clan will have the rights to
all bounties not yet collected.
 
A challenge is based upon a 20 point system.
 
Once an area is challenged by a clan there is a 3 "pulse" (regeneration pulse) delay
after which time scoring commences.  For each subsequent pulse that passes, whichever
clan has more members in the area at the time of the pulse will receive 1 point per
member in the area over their opponents.
 
So for example:
- Clan A challenges Clan B for control of Astoria
- Global message indicating a challenge has been made occurs
- Clan A receives a clan message indicating the challenge, as does clan B
- 3 pulses pass and scoring commences
- after pulse 4 clan A has 6 members in the area, clan B has 4
- clan A gains 2 points
- after pulse 5 clan A has 3 members in the area and clan B has 4
- clan B gains 1 point
- and so on
 
Additionally, any PKills *within* the area during the challenge period will earn a
clan 2 points.  So killing 3 members of a defending clan IN the challenged area
during a challenge will gain the attacking clan 6 points in addition to any points
accrued via "members in zone" (outlined above).

The first clan to reach 20 points via the above scoring will be considered the victor
of the challenge and either gain or retain a claim on the area in question.  All
uncollected bounties will be counted towards the winning clan's collectable total.

If a clan challenges for an area and fails, that clan cannot challenge for the same
area again for 36 ticks (approx. 30 minutes of real time).

If no clan has achieved the 20 points for a victory after 60 pulses, and no one
from either clan is in the area at that time, the area is then released from all
claims and can be reclaimed by any clan immediately.

If anyone from either clan is in the area when the time limit has been reached
without a victory, the defending clan retains control of the area.

In the case that both challenger and defender reach 20 points in the same pulse,
the tie goes to the defending clan and they retain control of the area.
 
Note that you can have as many challenges ongoing as you are allowed claimed areas.
This means if you have 4 online clan members and 2 claimed areas you can have up to
2 challenges ongoing at once.

Note that you must be IN the area in question to effect a challenge.
 
Syntax: clanarea challenge

$BNOTE regarding unclanned characters:$R
"clanarea challenge" is the only "clanarea" command that an unclanned player
can use.  Challenging for an area if you are not in a clan will result in the
same series of events and details listed above for clanned players, however
should your challenge be successful, the area will become "neutral" again
(free from any claim) rather than claimed by the victor.

As outlined above, the losing clan will have the standard waiting period before
they can again claim this area after losing it.

The collected funds are deposited directly into the appropriate clan account.

Note that it is very important to remember to use this command to collect your
clan's bounties regularly lest they be lost.  If an area is in the process of a
challenge, no collections can be made.

Any funds that are uncollected at the time of a challenge will be added to the
winner of the challenge's (either the challenger or defender) bounties and
can then be collected by the clan who holds the claim.

Any bounties not collected before a crash or reboot are lost forever.  As well,
any bounties left uncollected when your clan "yields" an area are also lost.
Note that you must be IN the area in question in order to collect the bounties.

Note that your own clan is NOT charged bounties in areas it has claimed.

BLACKJACK

BLACKJACK RULES
CASINO BLACKJACK
BLACK_JACK
CASINO, ROULETTE, POKER, SLOTS, BET, HIT, STAY, ASCII
L: 1
E:
Blackjack is easily the most popular table game of all.  In most casinos,
you will find that blackjack tables outnumber other table games by a
margin of about two to one.  The game enjoys its immense popularity for
many reasons, but one of the primary reasons is that, when played
correctly, it offers the best odds of all casino games.  A good blackjack
player's odds of winning are about even with the house.
 
The purpose of the game is to get a hand as close to 21 as possible
without going over.  A hand with a value over 21 is called a $B$7BUST$R,
and it is an automatic loser.  Your opponent in blackjack is the dealer,
and in order to win, you must beat the dealer's hand.  So whatever hand
you get must be less than 21, but still higher than what the dealer has.
 
Each card in blackjack has a certain value.  Cards between 2 and 10 (T)
have the face value of the card, regardless of the suit.  All face cards
(Jacks, Queens, and Kings) have a flat value of 10.  An Ace is a special
card - it can be counted two ways, either as 1 or 11, whichever is more
advantageous to your hand.  If counting an ace as 11 makes your hand go
over 21, then you would obviously count it as 1 so you can stay in the hand.
 
The highest hand is called a blackjack, which is composed of two cards that
equal 21.  The only way two cards can have a value of 21 is if one of them
is an Ace, and the other is a 10-value card. (ie. An ace and a king, and an
ace and a queen are both blackjacks.)  A blackjack beats all other hands
except for another blackjack.  So if you have a blackjack, and the dealer
has 3 cards that add up to 21, you still win the hand even though you both
have hands valued at 21.
 
Before the cards are dealt, each player must put up a $B$7BET$R.  Betting
limits in the casino vary from table to table, simply type "$B$7look table$R" to
view the tables limits.  To make a bet, simply enter $B$7BET <amount>$R.
 
After placing a bet, the player receives 2 cards, dealt face up.  The dealer
also receives two cards, but only one of the dealer's cards is face up.
Since the other card is face down, the player will not know what the dealer's
other card (also called the "hole card") is until the end of the hand.  In a
sense, the dealer's hand remains a mystery.
 
After receiving two cards, the player must decide whether to keep the hand as
is ($B$7STAY$R), or take additional cards in an attempt to raise the value of the
hand ($B$7HIT$R).  Remember, players must be careful when requesting additional
cards, because if their hands goes over 21, they $B$7BUST$R and lose
automatically.  The decision to take an additional card is called a $B$7HIT$R.
There is no limit on the number of hits a player can take.    
 
When players are done taking hits, they have chosen to $B$7STAY$R.  By staying,
a player simply accepts the hand as is, without any more hits.
 
Now it is the dealer's turn.  First, the dealer reveals his face down (hole)
card. If the dealer's hand is between 17 and 21, the dealer is NOT allowed to
take additional hits.  He MUST stand.  On the other hand, if the dealer's hand
is 16 or under, the dealer MUST take additional hits until the dealer's hand
has a value of 17 or higher.  If the dealer goes over 21 while taking
additional cards, he $B$7BUSTS$R and automatically loses.  
 
If you lose a hand, you lose the amount you originally bet - no more, no less.
If you win a hand, you get paid "even coins," meaning that you win the same
amount you wagered (1:1 odds).  So if you wagered 500 gold and won, you would
receive 500 additional gold.  If you hand is the same value as the dealer's
hand, it is called a $BPUSH$R or a tie.  In a $BPUSH$R, both sides neither
win nor lose.  

Since a blackjack is a special hand, it is paid extra.  Normally, a 500 gold
bet, if you win, will net you an additional 500 gold.  But with a blackjack,
you receive 1.5 times your original wager, or stated another way, you get 3:2
odds. This means you win a total of 750 gold on your 5 dollar bet when you have
a blackjack.
 
Those are the basic rules.  Pretty simple, right?  But wait - there are a
couple other things we have to cover before you dive in and start playing!

BLACKJACK SPLIT

NONE
NONE
CASINO BLACKJACK, BLACKJACK DOUBLE, INSURANCE, CASINO
L: 1
E:
Splitting is another way to double your stakes in blackjack.  You
can split when you have two cards of the identical value. (Example,
8 and an 8, Ace and an Ace, etc.)  By splitting your hand, you put
up an additional bet equal to your original bet.  You then play 2
separate hands, each starting with one of the split cards.  So if
you had two 8's and split them, you would create two hands, each
with a value of 8.  You would then proceed to play out each hand
separately, by hitting them until you are satisfied with the total.
If you obtain a blackjack on a split, you only get paid even money,
or 1:1 odds.  This is because your original hand was not in fact a
blackjack - you only got the blackjack after splitting your cards.
 
If splitting is available during a hand you will see it displayed
on the options menu during the hand. Simply type $B$7SPLIT$R at this

CASINO BLACKJACK, BLACKJACK SPLIT, INSURANCE, CASINO
L: 1
E:
As the name implies, a double or double down allows you to double
your wager.  You can double down ONLY when you have 2 cards in your
hand.  However, there is one condition.  When you double down, you
MUST take one, and only one more card.   You can NOT receive any
more hits after this.  Often times, players will double down when
their first two cards add up to 10 or 11.  Player in such cases are
hoping to receive a 10 or face card, thus making their hand a 20 or
21.  Why does a player do this?  Well, remember that a 10-card is
the most frequently occurring card in blackjack (after all, 10, J,
Q and K are all valued at 10).  So if you double down and receive
another card, there is a relatively high chance that you will receive
a 10.  That's why, when a player has 10 or 11, they will almost
always double down.  
 
If doubling is available during a hand you will see it displayed
on the options menu during the hand. Simply type DOUBLE at this
point to double down.  You also CAN double down on each hand after
a split.

CASINO BLACKJACK, BLACKJACK SPLIT, DOUBLE DOWN, CASINO
L: 1
E:
In the casino's blackjack, you are allowed to make an insurance
bet when the dealer's face card is an ace.  When the dealer has
an ace card showing, there is the possibility that the dealer
has a blackjack.  If the dealer does, you automatically lose,
unless you also have a blackjack, in which case you push. 
 
When you buy insurance, you are insuring yourself against the
possibility that the dealer has a blackjack.  The cost of
insurance is normally half of whatever your original bet is.
So if your bet is 100 gold, it costs 50 gold to buy insurance.
If the dealer does not have a blackjack, you lose your insurance
bet, and the hand is played out normally.
 
Now, here's the tricky part.  If the dealer does have a blackjack,
you lose your original bet (100 gold in our example) BUT you win
your insurance bet.  Since insurance pays 2:1, you would receive
100 gold on top of your 50 gold insurance bet.  In effect, you
lose 100 gold, but get paid 100, so it's a wash.  Basically, by
buying insurance you are preventing yourself from losing any money
if the dealer has a blackjack.

If insurance is available during a hand the dealer will announce it at
the start and give you an opportunity to purchase insurance.  If you
choose to purchase the insurance simply type $BINSURANCE$R when prompted.

$B$0A well preserved document bears the following information...$R

$B$7An excerpt from Phaedrus's Histories of the Guilds, Vol. III:$R
 
The druids' enclave has always been a secretive one, its membership
only recently being opened for nonhereditary guild members.  Despite
their acceptance of outsiders to the conclave, there are very few 
recorded instances of faithless druids leaving the brotherhood.
 
Many years ago, one druid of note broke with the conclave to pursue
a human female.  Most druids forsake companionship to know nature as
their first and only love; physical relationships are otherwise forbidden. 
This druid was cast out of the brotherhood and shunned, and though his
life was hard he found some measure of happiness with his mate.
 
One fateful day when the city of Enfania was under siege, this druid's
wife was murdered alongside the thousands who perished.  By then his
son had left him for the druid's enclave, training and studying to
atone for the sins of his father.  With nothing left and no one to turn
to, the druid began to contemplate his own death when Nature herself 
approached him.  She offered him forgiveness and the chance to redeem
himself both to his estranged and lost mistresses.  He could protect
a monument to Nature as he was unable to protect his wife, devoting
himself to the two women he loved as though they were one. 
 
This remarkable tree is said to have a breadth greater than the city of
Sorpigal...though, like reports of Stromboli's penis size, it is likely
greatly exaggerated.  The mighty tree is home to many woodland creatures 
whose purity affords them the grace of Nature herself.  Nature also 
watches out for some dangerous animals; reports of rabid raccoons have
come back from the cityguards, who warn these creatures may attack
without warning.  These raccoons have been a boon both for the city 
and for druids--their preferred diet seems to be mice, which has left
Sorpigal cleaner than ever and provided naturally expired mice as
components for druidic spells.
 
Somewhere in this tree a door leads to the master druid, who still 
keeps watch over the tree and its gentle creatures.  While the birds,
squirrels, and raccoons may be relatively weak even to the greenest
adventurer, the master druid is likely to be more than a match for
any who might seek to plunder Nature's chosen temple.  On a perpetual 
quest to renew Nature's bounty, he's always looking for acorns with
which to plant new trees.
 
One danger of note: though Nature herself offers no threat to those who
climb the tree, the branches are so high that falling from them may 
be very lethal.  Those who want the most spectacular view in the realms
would do well to have a fly spell handy or exercise extreme caution as
they proceed higher in the tree.
 
Visiting this piece of living history is easy.  Travel as far west 
from Sorpigal as possible and "climb" the tree.  Be careful--wargs and
wolves still prowl the Haon-Dor forest.

$B$0The following missive was intercepted by Sorpigal
Intelligence and is being distributed to the public as
a citizen alert.$R
 
Your Majesty,
 
My scrying of the Gnome Village is complete.  The
village layout is much like a cross and seems sparsely
populated with mostly women and children.  Here and
there a gnomish man or shopkeeper can be found.  They
should not be much more difficult to subdue than the
women and children as they are merely armed with
staves.  I think even your most novice of hobgoblin
soldiers should have no trouble with the commoners.  
 
The southern docks remain protected by a handful of
guards. This may make a riverside invasion difficult
as the guards have some combat training, though their
swords would make a fine addition to your armory.  It
seems they also have a small rodent problem as well.
 
Storming the northern part of the village with a
massed assault from your mines to the east should make
for a successful invasion.  The Chiefs residence can
be found here as well as the entrance to their
fortress.  I am positive that can you but capture the
fortress quickly, the guards to the south will not be
able to rally in time.  
 
The Chief will by far be the most difficult of the
gnomes to contend with, but perhaps if you were to
subdue him and take his head with his own Electrum
Sword, the fight could be taken out of the numerous
guards protecting the fortress.  I would not relish
having to face so many of those gnome guards but they
must be dealt with to find out what secret weapons the
Gnomes develop in the bowels of their fortress for use
against you.
 
And once the gnomes are taken care of I recommend
heading west and then south to subdue the Newtonians
before attempting to conquer the more heavily
fortified Sorpigal to the northeast.  Even as this
makes it way toward you I am marshalling a horde of
ensorcelled minotaurs for your use.  Though I must
admit these damned undead dwarves will not rest and
prevent any meaningful progress.  No matter for I will
deal with them before your army is ready to lay siege
to Sorpigal.  Perhaps the Orcish tribes can be
reunited as well.

that I disagree...talk about a cheeky bastard.  Most likely they're
in cahoots though.  Everybody knows hobgoblins are liars.  Heck,
they even say the hobgoblins have taken gnome prisoners.  They also
say that those mines are pretty rich in gold, enough where the King
had to get himself a treasurer to keep track of all that gold.  Now

Unfolding a piece of paper you discover a letter to the

Captain,
 
This Cantus and Hobgoblin business is becoming quite
worrisome.  The Hobgoblin King is now demanding that he be
allowed to see what lies Underneath Mayfair to ensure that
they pose no threat to his domain.  I myself have entered the
ramp and toured the area and saw nothing but gnomes doing
what they do best; creating rather worthless and far too
complicated contraptions.  Janikhel and his network also
believe that the gnomes are rather harmless.  But I had to
see for myself as I am loath to trust that silver-tongued
spymaster.
 
All the King would see is nothing more than scholars, tinker,
and their devices. The likes of which I don't think are too
much more dangerous than the average gnome.  Well maybe a
little more difficult in that they're smart enough to devise
these rather fantastic machines.  Either way, armed with that
knowledge I think the King would be more inclined to expand
his domain.  He would probably even claim their clockwork
devices to be weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).  This would
serve nicely as a reason for a preemptive strike though I am
certain no WMDs exist.  People give the Hobgoblin King too
little credit.  He is a cunning one and contributing to the
makings of one large headache.  He also has substantial
resources at his disposal thanks to a clever treasurer.  If
at all possible I would like you to station a small company
of men near the mines to deter the Hobgoblin King from any
aggressive action.  Let me know if this will conflict with
protecting the City.

AGGRO MOBS
DEATH, RDEATH, STAT LOSS, UNDERTAKER, PFE
L: 1
E:
Many mobs througout Dark Castle are less than accomodating to
adventurers as they travel about the realms.  Such mobs will often
attack or otherwise attempt to kill players on sight.

These are called "aggro" or "aggressive" mobs.

Some mobs are naturally "aggressive" either to specific races, alignments,
or just plain old everyone.  Other mobs have to be provoked into rage.

Whenever you damage a mob in any fashion or perform an offensive action
that could adversely affect it, that mob will get what is referred to
as a "hate flag" with your character's name.  Mobs that "hate" a
specific player will aggro them on sight.  Some mobs will even summon
a player they hate to their location as to beat up on them some more.
Mobs carry hate flags for any number of players foolish enough to
attempt to kill them and not finish the job.

Some abilities or spells can erase a hate flag or prevent a mob's
aggressive behavior.  Some of these include the bard's "Forgetful
Rhythm" or the "Protection from Good/Evil" spells.

L: 108
E:
The "set" command is one of the most powerful Immortal commands.
It allows an immortal to edit nearly any aspect of a character's
statistics.  For this reason if you are one of the few with this
ability, it should be use with the UTMOST caution and care.  This
is NOT an ability for buffing yours or your friend's characters or
your Immortal's statistics.  Abuse of this ability will generally
result in your removal from the Imm Staff.

There are a variety of options that this command can set, including:

        age               sex             class             level

The "eqmax" command is a command that when targetted on a player will
give output indicating the set of equipment a player can gain that
will maximize them in a certain characteristic.

For example: eqmax apocalypse damage
This would give the set of items that Apocalypse could use to get
the highest damage possible, taking into account his level, race,
and class. (alignment is ignored)

Additionally, the "nodoubles" optional command will give the output
without repeating any item twice.

CHANNELS, TELL, EMOTE
L: 106
E:
The "echo", "send", and "global" commands are all Immortal commands
that allow the user to send specific text to a player, location, or
worldwide.

The echo command will send specific text to everyone in the room.
The send command will deliver specific text to just one target's screen.
The Global command will delive specific text to the entire game.

Unlike emote, you do not have to use your name in the text.  You can
also use colour in messages and text you send.  This is a useful
command when running quests or wishing to send "role playing" type
information to a player, room, or the game.  It is also useful for
having a bit of fun with the mortals, but should not be taken to
extremes.

Example:
echo A large explosion blasts through the room.
global A large explosion in the distance shakes the earth beneath you.
send apocalypse You hear a large explosion in the distance.

Syntax:
echo <text>
global <text>
send <player> <text>

Note: this is also a very useful command for catching bots and setting
off bot triggers.

E:
$B$0After making a few inquiries about the Seaport of Sanderling,
a weathered looking old man beckons you to sit beside him to hear
the tragedy that befell Sanderling...$R
 
"I'll have you know that the Seaport of Sanderling has an old
history, much older than Sorpigal.  While today it serves as a
good starting point for any fledgling adventurer, long ago before
the War of Eternal Shadow, the port served as a base for some of
the most infamous pirates in the realm.
 
"Woe to the ship that was unable to outrun the black sails of
Sanderling.  And more woe to those caught who could not pay the
price of passage.  Aye, the pirates owned the oceans back in
that bygone era.  But they let their greed and hubris get the
better of them.
 
"One day the Captain of the pirates espied a most buxom mermaid
frolicking amongst the gentle waves beneath a cloudless day.  This
mermaid was young and had never interacted with mankind.  In fact
she had eluded her guardians to have herself a grand adventure.
So she did not know to flee for the depths upon sighting the dread
black sails and was captured on the Captain's orders.
 
"Well the pirates did what pirates do and ravished this young maid
of the sea.  How they did it, well I haven't really a clue, but
ravish her and worse they did.  And woe to the Scourge of the High
Seas, for this maid was actually a princess, the only daughter of
the Sea King.
 
"Well of course the King found out and in his fury he caused the
seas to swell and storm, the waves to pitch and toss the ships about
like toys in a two year old's bath.  The pirates tried to escape,
but many were sent to their deaths, to the depths of a watery grave.
 
"The pirate control of the oceans was broken.  The few ships that
limped back to Sanderling were no longer sea worthy.  Sure they tried
refurnishing their ships and even building new ones, but the King
stationed some of his people near the docks to prevent any craft
larger than a canoe from leaving.
 
"So today the denizens of Sanderling live in shacks and hovels,
dreaming of days gone by that will stay that way as long as the Sea
King reigns.  Now they are nothing more than smugglers and thugs,
surviving by supplying Sorpigal's black market.  If you plan on
visiting Sanderling you'll want to stop by the retired Captain to
purchase some waterborne transportation.  You can find him east of
Midwitch.
 
"You may also find that there is some equipment to be found that will 
benefit a fledgling adventurer.  As the pirates are pirates they won't 
willingly part with their goods, but if you can take it by force you
may find some use out of black pearl earrings, combs, and articles of
woven leather."
 
$B$0His tale done, the old man shuffles off leaving you to ponder about
this old salt wives' tale.$R

E:
$B$0The Soripgal Office of Tourism and Trade (SOTT) has provided the
following information bulletin about the High Seas...$R
 
While the beaches may be some of the most pristine throughout the
realm, the High Seas are characterized by choppy waters and
towering waves.  Unless prone to seasickness, this area is ideal
for untested adventurers as it offers a variety of sea life from
which to gather experience.  Go swimming with sharks, barracudas,
manta rays, and whales.  Arm wrestle with an octopus or simply
watch the fish swim by.  If you're fortunate you may even spot a
mermaid or two.  But be wary because the seas, or is it the
mermaids, are protected by monstrous kraken which will try and
drag you to the ocean floor.
 
If you want a closer look at the sea's bounty under the waters,
SOTT recommends you grow yourself a set of gills or visit Quark
near Sorpigal's East Gate to purchase a potion that will do the
trick.  To get to the High Seas visit the Captain who conducts
business east of Midwitch and purchase a boat.  South of him is
the river which you can follow west to the High Seas.  It is
recommended that unseasoned travellers not stray from the beaten
path once past the Seaport of Sanderling as the forests that line
the banks can be quite deadly.
 
While there is no consensus as to why this body of water is so
tumultuous, local lore has it that the Sea King, strengthened by
a magical robe, causes the seas to rage in anger over the dishonor
brought to his family by a band of pirates.

L: 1
E:
While a mage's constructed golem is one of the hardiest creatures in the
realms, it is not immune to the everyday wear and tear that all beings and
machines are subject to.  Through combat, travel, or other activities
a mage's golem can become severely worn; sometimes to the point of
literally falling to pieces.

It is for this reason that many master constructors within the mage guild
came together in an effort to lengthen the lifespan and durability of their
creations.  From this gathering the powerful "mend golem" spell was born.

The spell's creators soon discovered that, while they could not fully
repair all the damage a golem had sustained with one single spell, it was
a fairly simple matter to focus their magic to repair nearly a fifth
of their golem's durability (hit points) with each single casting.

it should NOT be used on players unless given prior permission by an

consent.  $BIt is *NOT* a form of player punishment.$R

Similarly it is NOT to be used on a mob to help a player acquire
equipment, even it is your own character.  This is a zappable offense.

Note: "kill" for immortals has been changed to a regular attack, same
as "hit".  "Kill" is no longer a real kill when used by an immortal.

These commands are bestowed and used for editing skill quests through
an automated system with the guild masters.  There is little reason
to need to use these commands without a specific purpose.

Typing "sqedit" gives a syntax output on usage.
"sqsave" saves any changes made to skill quests.

When you are making or editing the message, "sqedit message <skill_name>"
will put you in the editor.  Old style editor, with the tilde for closing out
the editor.

The guildmaster wont automatically SAY whatever you put in the message, you
need to explicitly start the line with "say" just as if you were possessing
the mob and needed to say something.  This also means you can have the mob
do socials, or any other valid command in the message.

The first line of the message must not be blank.
If it is blank, this will result in nothing happening.

This command can be used on either an online or offline character in
order to find out a basic stat sheet of details about said character.

It provides basic connection information, home room, and a few other
details as shown in the example below:

E:
This command will allow the user to open the arena with various modifiers.
Options listed below:
 
$Barena <lower level> <higher level>$R
  - this opens the arena for a specific level range of players.
    (Note the "lower" range MUST be 6 or higher as level 5 players
    and below unable to fight other players.)
 
$Barena <lower level> <higher level>$R <# of players>
  - this opens the arena for a specific level range to the first X players
    to join. (where X is the # specified)
 
$Barena 0 0$R
  - this closes the arena and allows combat to commence.
 
$Barena <lower level> <higher level> chaos$R
  - opens the arena for a specified level range and to clanned players
    only.  It also starts the "chaos.log" file logging arena kills.
 
$Barena <lower level> <higher level> potato$R
  - starts a potato arena (help potato arena)
 
$Barena <lower level> <higher level> <# of players> prize$R
 - starts a prize arena and enhanced imm logging for refereeing purposes.
 
$Barena <lower level> <higher level> hp <PC max hp>$R
- starts an arena with a specificed hp cap that prevents players with
  more natural hp than the cap number from joining.
 
Note: remember to CLOSE the arena once players have joined or they will
      be stuck in there indefinetly.

RANGE
ZONE RANGE
ROOM RANGE
RANGE COMMAND
NONE
ZEDIT, MEDIT, OEDIT, REDIT, ZONEFILE, INSTALL
L: 104
E:
The range command is easily one of the most dangerous and powerful
commands at a builder or other immortal's disposal.  As such it should
be used with a GREAT deal of care and precision.

The range command provides 2 abilities:
1) The ability to edit any mob, object, room, or zonefile in the game.
    To do this the Imm with the range ability need only go to the room
    they wish to edit the room or zonefile for and begin editing OR
    simply medit/oedit the mob or object they wish to work on from
    anywhere in the game.

$B$5DO NOT EDIT MOBS OR OBJS OUTSIDE OF YOUR DESIGNATED RANGE WITHOUT PERMISSION$R

2) The abilty to set the mob, object, or room/zone range for other Imms.
    Most builders/architects do not have the ability to edit outside
    of their deignated ranges and as such require a change on occasion
    to allow them to edit other things associted with their area.
    The syntax below shows how to set this up for them.
    NOTE: Only authorized persons should EVER use the range command
          to grant ranges to other Immortals.

Syntax: range <god> <r|m|o> <number|'none'>

Note that while "show zone all" gives the numbers for each room range,
the mob and object ranges do not necessarily coincide, and as such
must be checked carefully when setting. (this sometimes takes a
couple tries.)
#

INSTALL
INSTALL AREA
AREA INSTALL
NONE
NONE
REDIT, ZEDIT, MEDIT, OEDIT
L: 108
E:
The install command is what is used to create new room, mob, obj, and
zonefile ranges.

$BSyntax: install <range #> <# of rooms> <world|obj|mob|zone|all>$R
 ie. install 29100 100 m = installs mob range 29100-29199.
      (29100 = range 29100, 100 = 100 rooms (29100 to 29199), m = mob file)

This is a very dangerous command to use if you do not understand the
proper syntax.  Take note.

SEDIT
SKILL EDIT
SPELL EDIT
SEDIT COMMAND
NONE
SKILLS, SPELLS, SET, RULES, PRAC
L: 108
E:
This immortal command is used for adding, removing, and setting skills on players.
It should NOT BE EVER USED without prior approval from an Implementor.  It should
also not ever be used without a specific reason in mind (ie testing on a test char).
It is NOT for buffing up your morts.

The syntax for this command can be found by entering "sedit" with no arguments.
If you need further clarification this either means:
a) you shouldn't be using this command
or
b) you need to talk to an Implementor.

Note that changes that are not part of a class' actual stats or over a char's max
will NOT save on relog and will reset.
(Meaning you can't give a barbarian fireshield.  It won't save.)

E:
 $B$0Surely the fates are smiling upon you for two soldiers, one bloodied
and bandaged, have paused near you in the midst of a heated discussion...$R
 
"...can't be done.  It was a small expeditionary force to begin with,
but once we entered the mound we lost two men right at the start to a
monstrous antlion.  Our forces were then divided to navigate what turned
out to be a large maze, only to be set upon by crazed minotaurs.  These
beasts fought as if they felt no pain.  Often they would be frothing at
the mouth and their eyes rolled back into their sockets.  And while
their fury was often without strategy or reason, it turns out Cantus
had a surprise for us.  Monstrosities they were, these giant
manscorpions.  I don't know if they were creations of Cantus but their
scorpion tails felled many of us."
 
$B$0The second solider thinks for a moment...$R
 
"What about the dwarven ghosts?  The bulletin said that they prevented 
Cantus from marching. Surely they helped?"
 
$B$0The first wounded soldier's body spasms as it wracked by a series of
coughs.  Only until after the fit has passed does he respond.$R
 
"The dwarves were perhaps the worst.  In their grief or rage at being
dead they attacked the living with no mercy.  Worse, our weapons did
not faze them.  The mound is a foul place to travel, and I think only
the protection of the gods would let one trespass unmolested, or maybe
invisibility.  But we had neither mage nor cleric to grant us their
gifts.  We were able to put scouts on the ledge overlooking the maze
but they merely confirmed that we had not enough force.  We do not even
know if Cantus is at the center of the maze.  Our scouts were only able
to make out some sparkling object set atop a giant palm at the center.
And if the manscorpions were a surprise, there's no telling what other
creatures might be lurking about in that labyrinth."
 
"Surely we can go back with a larger force?", $B$0the second soldier asks.$R
 
$B$0The first soldier cuts him off quickly saying...$R
 
"A larger force or skilled adventurers could probably clear out the
mound with ease.  But fledgling adventurers should be wary.  And by the
way our company fought, it would seem that we were naught but boys with
wooden sticks playing at being men.  Yes, a larger force would work but
where will Sorpigal get that force.  The guard is already lean with the
double shifts.  And you heard that the Mayor wants to post a company
near the Hobgoblin mines."
 
$B$0The second soldier looks forward and replies:$R
 
"The guilds will surely lend us their support."
 
$B$0The first soldier gives a rueful chuckle...$R
 
"You are naive to think that.  Hydel complains that the Guard is
recruiting his warriors before they are ready.  Drawan's clerics are
spread thin tending the injured from this latest disaster on top of all
the normal injuries that occur on a daily basis.  Of Montolio's rangers,
half of them will not aid us unless the wilderness is threatened while
the other half chases the four winds seeking further news of war.
Janikhel told the Mayor he would not commit his guild without reasonable
payment.  I heard that with my own two ears.  The Mayor complained that
he would have to raise taxes to accomplish that."
 
$B$0The second soldier looks concerned...$R
 
"What about the druids, monks, barbarians, bards, and mages?  What about
the paladins and anti-paladins?"
 
$B$0Shaking his head, the first soldier states:$R
 
"They are much the same.  The druids are worse than the rangers.
Seamus long ago declared that no druid would involve themself in such
matters unless Nature is threatened.  Sahmot Notrem also long ago
declared that the monks would fight only in self-defense.  So we cannot
count on them until evil calls at the gate.  The bards, while mighty in
battle, are too few.  And while you might get Boyle or Marrok to agree,
you'll never get both as the paladins and anti-paladins always disagree
on action on a matter of principle.  The barbarians will help, as
Berkthgar's kith and kin are always eager for a battle.  But that is no
grand alliance of the guilds."
 
$B$0The second soldier looks plaintive...$R
 
"What about the mages?"
 
$B$0The wounded soldier's initial response is to spit on the ground.$R
 
"Alianna is the worst.  She has ordered the Mayor to cease and desist.  
Something about the problem of Cantus being one to be addressed by the
Mage Council.  She's called for some Grand Convocation, but knowing
those air-brained dolts they'll dither and dally about until it's too
late."
 
$B$0The second soldier says:$R
 
"We won't have much time.  The Minotaur Mound is just south of the Turning 
Point.  I wonder how Juan would have handled all this."
 
"You're still going on about that?", $B$0says the 1st soldier, sighing.$R
 
"He did hand out free burritos.", $B$0the second soldier says defensively.$R
 
"The same burritos that had your gut aching, that had you going to the 
crapper every five minutes?, $B$0replies the first solfier.$R
 
"Good point.", $B$0comments the second soldier.$R
 
$B$0With this said the two begin to chuckle and grin, the wounded one
wincing in the process.  The discussion seemingly over, or at least at
a natural pause, the two look over and notice that you've been
eavesdropping, which means it's your cue to leave.$R

E:
Oclone is for creating an item that is identical to an existing item.
The newly created item will have the specified vnum but otherwise
be identical.  You can then make adjustments to the clone instead
of starting from scratch with an empty item template.
 
Syntax: oclone <source (existing) vnum> <destination (empty-item) vnum> 
 
$BBe extremely careful with oclone!$R
It is a very easy way to accidently screw up any existing item that
is in your range.  For anyone with the "range" command, that really
really means any item in the game.
 
If you DO accidently overwrite the wrong vnum, simply be careful NOT
to save, and request a reboot as soon as possible.
 
Note: oclone will NOT copy any special procs/progs over to the new mob.

E:
$B$0The Sorpigal Office of Tourism and Trade (SOTT) has issued the
following advisory...$R
 
Nestled in the foothills of the World's Spine, the Kingdom of
Astoria was granted to the great paladin Garax for his service in
the War of Eternal Shadow.  Known for its jewels and woolen finery,
especially its surcoats, Astoria's growing prosperity was quickly
tempered by the untimely and suspicious death of the King.  His will
stating that his heir would have all five pieces of his arms and
armor, a new king has not yet been crowned as all four of his sons
hold a piece of his equipment and equally lay claim to the throne.
 
The location of the fifth piece remains unknown.  Some suspect that
it lies with the King's remains but this rumor remains
unsubstantiated as the four sons are unwilling to come together with
their keys to unlock the sealed castle of Garax.
 
For the time being, sectarian violence has been virtually
non-existant but tensions continue to build.  While even the most
fledgling of adventurers should have no problems in this isolated
kingdom north of Sorpigal, SOTT can no longer guarantee the safety
of travelers in this region especially as banditry continues to grow
along the Mountain's Edge Road.  Because of this banditry and growing
suspicions among the four sons, the gates of Astoria have been locked
to outsiders.  Their representative to the realms is said to carry the
key to the gates.  It is also said that he masquerades as a wandering
pilgrim.  Be advised that he will not part with the key willingly.
 
While a caution to possible regional instability and escalation in
sectarian violence, SOTT in no way discourages adventurers from
avoiding Astoria. In fact SOTT recommends any would-be tourists to
Astoria to sample one of Metzger's most delicious squirrel-kabobs or
shop at many of the other stores that are unique to this small kindgom.

$B$0A crumpled letter has found its way into your hands...$R
 
My dearest Lyra,
 
I am so glad to hear that you have found a teaching
position in Sorpigal's Bard Academy.  It seems like only
yesterday that you were strumming away on your first harp.
I find myself troubled over the developments regarding
Cantus and the Hobgoblin King, but I fear Zyekia will not
be able to come to Sorpigal's aid should it come to war.
 
Our kingdom's power has waned considerably since the days
of the War of Eternal Shadow.  It is becoming more of a
task to defend the borders against the neighboring kingdoms.
But perhaps there is a silver lining in the dire news you
have brought to my attention.  Could this be the second
herald to our glorious rebirth?  The kingdom has already
mostly withdrawn from the matters of the realm.
 
I must try and convey this news to Kalek.  His fervor in
the belief that the Shijoh will soon walk the mortal plane
and lead Zyekia to glory has only intensified in the past
few years.  This has translated to a growing zealotry among
the Jiran.  The Selrith numbers have never been higher.  It
all seems more a dark stain in our breasts, the darkest in
the hearts of the Seertih and Isilric; especially Isilric.
The King takes his council from those two more and more
these years.  Where I was once his most trusted advisor, I
cannot even get Lady Eelia to pass along my wisdom for I have
been banished to the outskirts of the Kingdom with the
rescanths and dynzees.
 
These are troubling times indeed.  My child, if the dogs of
war truly are straining at their tethers then you must
return home quickly.  While our power has weakened so that
most novice adventurers could challenge a selrith, the birth
of the Second Age will change everything.  I know it has been
a long time since you left home so I have included the
directions below.
 
Hurry home,

COMBAT, JOIN, GROUP, CHARMIEJOIN
L: 1
E:
The autojoin command allows you to specify players (or followers)
that you wish to automatically join in combat.
 
When you specify who you are joining it will then check during combat
to see if any of those persons are fighting.  If this is the case, your
character will automatically "join <person/follower>" and begin to
fight.
 
Should you be present in the room at the *start* of combat, a check
on your "$Brapid join$R" skill will occur and, if successful, you will
immediately join at the start of combat even if the person you are
joining led with a spell or skill.
(This means you would join on a player's backstab rather than the
initial basic attack.)

$BRapid Join$R can be learned and practiced at the $BSkills Master$R.
 
In summary, autojoin allows you to join on a once per round check
but the "rapid join" skill will give you a chance based on your
skill level to join anyone you specify immediately.
 
Syntax: $Bautojoin$R
          (with no arguments shows who you are joining and syntax)
        $Bautojoin <player1> <player2> <player3> etc$R
          (Note: specifiying a player a second time will remove them
           from your join list.)
        $Bautojoin clear$R
          (clears completely your autojoin queue)

To join your charmie/follower in combat use the name "Follower" or
"Followers".  This will cause the same join feature to work for
charmies (corpses, elementals, golems, etc).

Note: The order any names are specified in has no affect on the
      speed or order that you join a person.  You will simply join
      the first person or follower that is seen fighting and is
      on your list.

$B$0A cloaked apprentice to the Grand Master appears in a roar of $B$4flame$0!$R
 
So you want to be a great sorcerer do you?  The Tower of High Sorcery 
usually snatches up those with any hint of talent, though they have been 
known to miss one here and there.  You didn't run away from Ezmerelda's 
kitchens did you?  I don't imagine you'd tell me the truth anyways.  Guess I 
can't say I blame you.  That old harridan rides those apprentices harder 
than the Grand Master of Magic herself.  Well first thing's first.  Go check 
in with the mage guild.  You can always hole up there if you find the 
patrons of the Albatross Tavern too rambunctious.  From the Tavern go:
   $B4 south, 2 west north$R 
 
While you're there find Alianna and learn Magic Missile.  Type:
   $Bpractice magic missile$R  [see also help PRACTICE].
 
Magic Missile is the first of many spells in a Spellslinger's arsenal.  It's 
the bread and butter and you'll often find yourself using it to conserve 
mana in more lengthy runs.  You can test it out in the Mud School's arena 
which is above the Tavern.  Be sure to explore around the school so you can 
pick up beginner equipment and items.  You'll especially want to grab a Mud 
School Diploma to boost your stats when you gain levels [see also HELP 
GAIN].  As you gain levels you will probably want to gather equipment that 
gives bonuses to INT, WIS, and mana.
 
INT [see also HELP INT] determines how much you advance your skills per
practice and also for proficiency [see also HELP MAGE], your mana regen
rate, and your spell concentration.  INT is one of the more important, if
not the most important, attribute for a mage.  You will also want to look at
the help files for the other attributes to see how they affect a character
for gaining purposes.
 
$BUse the $5INDEX$7 command to effectively list the available helpfiles.$R
[see also HELP INDEX]
 
Don't be too concerned early on with equipment that gives bonuses to hit
and damage as mages do the brunt of their damage via spells and don't do
particularly well in combat going toe-to-toe, at least initially.  Regular
paper tigers they are.
 
As far as gaining experience points for leveling if you're running solo you 
will want to kill mobs in one or two spells.  Remember you regenerate mana 
much faster than hit points.  Good places to start after getting acquainted 
with the Mud School are Mushroom Caverns, Kilderry, and Mighty Tree.
[see HELP AREAS for a comprehensive area list]
 
Once you acquire Lightning Bolt you will find more often than not that the 
non-military gnomes in the Gnome Village [see also HELP GNOME VILLAGE] will 
die on a 2nd Lightning Bolt.  If you manage to find a GROUP [see HELP GROUP
and HELP TANK], well just sit back and let the spells fly.
 
Another thing, while Alianna will teach you many of the spells in your 
arsenal, you sometimes will have to set upon a small quest in order to add
a new spell to your bag of tricks.  Usually there is enough of a hint in 
the clue to figure out where you need to go by looking at HELP AREAS.  If 
you find yourself stumped try using the newbie channel or asking a guide for 
help [see also HELP GUIDE].  This is a good way to also ask about what 
equipment is good for your class and level.  Once you find information on 
utile equipment you can use the auction channel to try and buy it if you are 
unable to get a group together to run the equipement [see also HELP 
AUCTION].  You will also find that each spell has its own separate help 
file.  Some spells are more useful than others so you might want to conserve 
your practices for useful but less used spells while gaining proficiency 
through use the spells more often used.
 
Hopefully this is enough information to get you started and to keep you from 
becoming worm food.  If you have any questions feel free to ask or use the 
newbie channel.  Just remember that answers from those without (GUIDE)
before their names might not provide truthful answers.
Oh, and Welcome to Dark Castle!

E:
Warriors and Barbarians, due to their significant levels of combat
experience and battle-tested abilities, have developed their skills
of battlefield triage and administering to their own wounds.  They
are also well aware that a combat veteran rarely gets any extended
rest and relaxation.  As such, true warriors have honed their
ability to both maximize what rest time they have and to bandage and
treat their own injuries.

These skills result in both warriors and barbarians being able to 
heal their hit points and moves much more quickly than other classes.
The further a warrior or barbarian advances this skill, the more
improved their regenerative abilities will be.

This is an automatic skill and does not require any commands to be
entered.  It will only improve if the warrior or barbarian is
resting or sleeping outside of a safe (or no_learn) room.

$B$0A fairly scruffy but friendly looking woodsman ambles forward...$R
 
Welcome to Dark Castle my young bestiaphile!  It's not often we see animal 
lovers around these days.  It used to be they were a dime a dozen.  
Prominent among them were Parry and the one and only Dinas Dragonbane.  
Between you and me the dragons feared him not for his slaying capabilities 
but for his tendency to have his way with the great reptiles, if you catch 
my drift.
 
As I was saying, rangers used to be all over the place.  With their various 
skills and nature knowledge this hybrid class excels at running solo.  The 
large amounts of gold they procured used to go mostly toward bribing the 
Mayor of Sorpigal to ignore their deviant practices.  Ever since the Mayor's 
run for re-election under the campaign of ending corruption these bribes 
have since disappeared along with the once open flaunting of a ranger's love 
for his animal companions.
 
Since not everyone understands the special bond between a ranger and his 
companion you will want to familiarize yourself with the Ranger Guild.  If 
you are in the Albatross Tavern, this safe haven can be found
   $B1 south, 6, west, 2 south$R
 
You might also want to pay a visit to the guild master, Montolio DeBrouchee. 
He can teach you Bee Sting, one of your more integral beginning spells.
Type $Bpractice bee sting$R [see also HELP PRACTICE] to learn this spell.
 
From him you will also learn many of the other skills and spells inherent to
being a ranger.  Some of the skills are beyond even his ken and he will send
you on a small $BSKILL QUEST$R with a clue.  Usually there is enough of a 
hint in the clue to figure out where you need to go by looking at $BHELP 
AREAS$R.  If you find yourself stumped try using the newbie channel or asking 
a guide for help [see also HELP GUIDE].
 
Speaking of areas, a good place to start earning experience is the Mud 
School.  It is located above the Albatross Tavern.  It's a public school so 
be warned that you might not get the greatest of an education.  If you 
explore around you'll find some beginner equipment and items.  You'll find 
the diploma is useful for leveling [see also HELP GAIN].  Being part fighter 
and part spellcaster, equipping a ranger can be quite a balancing act.  A 
ranger enjoys benefits from equipment that gives bonuses to hit points, mana 
points, and +hit/damage.  Finding the right set-up for your style of play 
might take a little experimentation.
 
You'll definitely want equipment that gives bonuses to your stats when
gaining [see also HELP GAIN] a fresh level at your guild.  Your CONSTITUTION
will determine how many hit points you gain upon leveling and your hit point
and movement regeneration rates [see also HELP CON and HELP REGEN].  It also
is an important attribute for the ranger as it affects a ranger's proficiency
in many of his spells [see also HELP RANGER].  WIS is important in determining
the number of practices you gain upon leveling.  INTELLIGENCE determines how
well you progress in your proficiency of a skill or spell with each practice.
 
Each stat, and virtually any other topic on Dark Castle has its own help file.
$BYou can use the $5INDEX$7 command to effectively list the available files.$R
[see also HELP INDEX].  Some basic information to get you on the road can also
be found in many of the helpfiles geared for new players such as:
   $Bhelp NEWBIE, help GETTING STARTED, help NEWBIE AREAS, help NEWBIE EQ$R
 
The newbie channel or asking guides are a good way to ask about what 
equipment is good for your class and level.  Once you find information on 
useful equipment, you can use the auction channel to try and purchase it from
another player.  Alternately you can try to get a $BGROUP$R together to run
some equipment [see also HELP AUCTION, HELP GROUP, and HELP TANK].
 
You will also find that each spell and skill has its own separate help file.
Some are more useful than others so you might want to conserve your practices
for useful but less used spells while gaining proficiency through use the spells
more often used [see also HELP LEARN and help IMPROVE]
 
Once you familiarize yourself with the Mud School you can try your luck at 
the Mushroom Caverns, Kilderry, or the Great Tree.  HELP AREAS will provide 
a list of other areas you might try exploring.
 
Once you reach level 11 be sure to head back to Montolio and learn tame
[see also HELP TAME and HELP ORDER].  This is one of the defining skills of a
ranger.  Though it's been a while since I've indulged in the crustacean fetish
(I've since grown quite fond of riding moose bareback), I believe busy lobsters
from the Mushroom Caverns make excellent companions for the beginning ranger.
Early on you might try alternating as the tank [see also HELP TANK] with your
animal companion but as you grow and learn new skills and spells the frequency
of this will lessen.
 
I hope this is enough information to get you started and to keep you from 
being lynched by PETA.  If you have any questions feel free to ask or use 
the newbie channel.  Just remember that answers from those without 
(GUIDE) before their names might not provide truthful answers.

QUEST SKILLS, DRUID, SPELLS, CHARMIE EQ, CHARMIES
L: 1
E:
Druids, through their intimate relationship with nature and the
elements, have an intimate understanding of the elements and
elemental planes.  As such, they are able to summon forth
controlled elementals from the elemental planes to do their bidding.
 
There are 4 varieties of elementals that druids can conjure forth:
  $B$4Fire$R, from the elemental plane of fire.
  $B$7Ice$R, from the elemental plane of water.
  $B$5Lightning$R, from the elemental plane of air.
  $B$0Earth$R, from the elemental plane of earth.
 
Each of these elementals have their own unique strengths and abilities.
Some have more hit points than others, while others do increased damage
or have powerful shields or protections.  A druid new to the powers of
conjuring elementals should experiment and test with each type.
 
Elementals magical control over their essence allows them to wear the
equipment traditional to all charmed followers.
 
Each of these elementals does damage based on their element rather than
traditional strikes.
  $B$4Fire$R elementals deal fire damage.
  $B$7Ice$R elementals deal water damage.
  $B$5Lightning$R elementals deal energy damage.
  $B$0Earth$R elementals deal crushing damage.
 
To conjure forth an elemental, the druid must have a liquid container
of the appropriate type in their inventory.  Upon casting, 5 "drinks"
from the container will be used up.  This allows for multiple summonings
from a single container.  Clues to where some containers of the
appropriate kind can be found in the druids guild from the wandering
centaur, Kentaros.  Simply mention (say) "conjure elemental" in his
presence.
 
The following lists the types of containers required:
  $B$4Fire$R elementals require a liquid container of blood.
  $B$7Ice$R elementals require a liquid container of holy water.
  $B$5Lightning$R elementals require a liquid container of wine.
  $B$0Earth$R elementals require a liquid container of dirty water.
 
Elementals, despite their tremendous powers, cannot survive in an area
(room sector) that is the opposite of their natural home plane.
Each elemental, should they enter such a sector, will immediately
return to their own plane of existence, leaving behind any items they
may have been wearing.
  $B$4Fire$R elementals cannot enter "underwater" sector rooms.
  $B$7Ice$R elementals cannot enter "desert" sector rooms.
  $B$5Lightning$R elementals cannot enter "swamp" sector rooms.
  $B$0Earth$R elementals cannot enter "air" sector rooms.
 
Similar to the druid's familiar, the conjured elementals are able to stay
with their summoner even if the druid is moved by magical means.
 
$BNote:$R The higher a druid's skill in their conjure elemental spell, the
more hit points their elemental will have.  Furthermore, at the highest
levels of skill, the elemental's aura will be so powerful as to provide
the druid and his or her group with an "enhanced elemental aura" of the
same type as the elemental.  These auras will provide some enhancement
to the groups' offensive spells of the appropriate type.

Mclone is for creating a mob that is identical to an existing mob.

of starting from scratch with an empty mob template.
 
Syntax: mclone <source (existing) vnum> <destination (empty-mob) vnum> 
 
$BBe extremely careful with mclone!$R
It is a very easy way to accidently screw up any existing mob that
is in your range.  For anyone with the "range" command, that really
means any mob in the game.
 
If you DO accidently overwrite the wrong vnum, simply be careful NOT
to save, and request a reboot as soon as possible.

L: 1
E:
Veteran warriors, through their intensive training and battle seasoned
abilities and experience, are able to hone their abilities to a point
where, regardless of the weapon they choose, they are able to master
its use.

This skill is referred to as "Combat Mastery".
Combat Mastery has 4 significant affects for a warrior.

The warrior's ability to "skewer" an opponent when wielding a piercing
or slashing weapon is well known.  Combat mastery adds to and enhances
this ability to extend to several other weapon types.

First, when the warrior is wielding a bludgeoning or crushing weapon,
they have a chance to land a "crushing blow" which will cause their
opponent to deal only 50% of normal damage for the next round of combat.

Second, when the warrior is wielding a whipping weapon, they have a
chance to cause their opponent to "stumble and fall", causing them
to "sit" for a round of combat.

Third, when the warrior is wielding a stinging weapon, they have a
chance to land a "stinging blow" that temporarily blinds their opponent
for the next round of combat.

Finally, as their expertise with all weapons and armours is honed to
the peak of its potential, the warrior receives a bonus to their
armor class (AC) based upon how well they have developed their mastery
of combat.

Much like skewer, this is an automatic skill and requires no command
to activate.

to heal even the deadliest of injuries they may have received.

The amount of healing they receive is directly correlated to the amount
of hit points the are able to regenerate per tick when in a sleeping state.

You ever notice that certain classes are maligned for their deviancies
more than others?  You got your druids and their dendrophila.  Bards
are flagrantly homoerotic.  And what ranger can pass on some prime
virgin wool?  What about those holier than thou clerics that cavort
with corpses or little boys; or worse the corpses of little boys?
 
What about thieves?  Always sneaking up behind you and sticking you
with phallic instruments.  Then they run away like they're ashamed
only to come back and do it again like they can't resist the
temptation of a good reach around...
 
Newbie thieves start taking notes.  This is the way to start 
gaining experience as thieves aren't blessed with the biggest of
"hit-points": $Bstab and flee, rinse and repeat.$R
[see HELP BACKSTAB and HELP FLEE]
 
You can learn backstab [Type practice backstab] and other skills
[see HELP PRACTICE and HELP THIEF] from the thief guildmaster,
Janikhel.  The thief guild can be found from the Albatross Tavern by
heading: $Bnorth, 3 east, 2 north$R.
 
If Janikhel can't teach you the skill he will send you on a small
$BSKILLQUEST$R with a clue.  Usually there is enough of a hint in the clue
to figure out where you need to go by looking at $BHELP AREAS$R.  If you
find yourself stumped try using the newbie channel or asking a guide
for help [see also HELP GUIDE].
 
Speaking of areas, a good place to start earning experience is the Mud
School.  It is located above the Albatross Tavern.  If you explore
around you'll find some beginner equipment and items.  You'll find the
diploma is useful for leveling [see also HELP GAIN].  Being a fighter
you'll want to find equipment that gives bonuses to hit and damage, hit
points, and perhaps your stats also.  $BDEXTERITY$R is a very important
stat for a thief.  Not only does DEX affect your bonus/penalty to your
hit roll, armour class, and movement points gained per level, it also
determines how well you can learn many of the thief skills.
 
You'll definitely want equipment that gives across the board bonuses to
your stats when gaining [see also HELP GAIN] a fresh level at your
guild.  Your $BCONSTITUTION$R will determine how many hit points you gain
upon leveling and your hit point and movement regeneration rates [see
also HELP CON and HELP REGEN].  $BWISDOM$R is important in determining the
number of practices you gain upon leveling.  $BINTELLIGENCE$R determines how 
well you progress in your proficiency of a skill with each practice. You 
will find that each skill has its own separate help file.  Some might
find that some are used more often than others so you might want to
conserve your practices for the useful but less used skills while
gaining proficiency through use in those that are more often used.
[see HELP LEARN and HELP IMPROVE]
 
Each stat, and virtually any other topic on Dark Castle has its own help 
file.  You can use the $BINDEX command$R to effectively list the available
files [see also HELP INDEX].  Some basic information to get you on the
road can also be found in many of the helpfiles geared for new players
such as:
$Bhelp NEWBIE, help GETTING STARTED, help NEWBIE AREAS, help NEWBIE EQ$R
 
The newbie channel or asking guides are a good way to ask about what 
equipment is good for your class and level.  Once you find information on 
useful equipment, you can use the auction channel to try and purchase it 
from another player.  Alternately you can try to get a GROUP together to
run some equipment [see also HELP AUCTION, HELP GROUP, and HELP TANK].
 
Once you familiarize yourself with the Mud School you can try your luck
at the Mushroom Caverns, Kilderry, or the Great Tree.  HELP NEWBIE AREAS
will provide a list of other areas you might try exploring.
 
 
Seriously though, can we say passive aggressive homosexuality?  What with 
all the lurking in the shadows [see $BHELP SNEAK$R and $BHELP HIDE$R], trailing 
their victims so they can watch that ass [see $BHELP STALK$R].  It's no
wonder thieves do what they do to get some.  Whatever happened to saying,
"Hi, can I buy you a drink sometime?"  Though with a thief you're likely
to get served some GHB or troll spit with that drink [see HELP SLIP].
 
You have to give some credit to the thief mentality though.  Yes means
yes, no means yes, and being arrested for sexual assault means the thief
took too long.  Persistent buggers, it's hard to outrun a thief with them
cutting your belt and tripping you up [see $BHELP TRIP$R].  Have you ever
tried running with your pants around your ankles?  Not an easy thing to do.
And I'm not sure if them knocking you and then having their way with you
is a good thing or not [see $BHELP JAB$R].  On one hand you don't witness
yourself being made humble.  On the other hand you might wake up with your
pockets emptied after having been made humble [see $BHELP POCKET$R and $BHELP
STEAL$R].  Talk about added insult to injury.
  
I hope you've learned enough to get started playing a thief (and how deep
down inside you're a twisted little monkey).  If you have any questions
feel free to ask or use the newbie channel.  Just remember that answers
from those without $B(GUIDE)$R before their names might not provide
truthful answers.

QUEST SKILLS, THIEF, SKILLS, SKILL QUEST
L: 1
E:
Thieves, as some of the dirtiest fighters known to the realms, have
no compunction against delivering a low blow, cheap shot, or other
disabling strike to their opponents.  As such, they have honed this
ability to deliver a crippling blow into an art of sorts.

When a successful crippling blow is landed, the thieves' opponent
suffers several uncomfortable effects.

1) While crippled, the victim loses 1 melee attack per round.
2) The crippled player receives 1 round of lag on any directional
   movement (n/s/e/w/u/d/flee).
3) Crippled casters suffer a penalty to concentration. (up to 10%)

While debilitating, the effects of such a low blow from a rogue are
fortunately short lived (and skill based).  A victim is crippled for
the same brief period both in or out of actual combat.

Either as a result of the movements required to land such a blow,
or possibly because the rogue is caught up laughing at their victim,
the thief landing the blow will find themselves lagged for 2 rounds.

E:
Fire opals are unique in the lush world of gemstones. They are admired
as symbols of the most fervent love from ancient times.  In Thalos and
in the Thelian kingdom, as well as among the peoples of the Diamond Isle,
it is believed that a gem that bubbled over with vivacity to such an
extent could only have been created in the waters of paradise.
 
The ancient Zyekians loved this gemstone dearly and used it in mosaics
and for ritualistic purposes.  They called it "quetzalitzlipyollitli"
or the "stone of the bird of paradise".  Yet, the gemstone knowledge of
Zyekia's natives, which had been handed down for generations, somehow
sank into oblivion for many ages...
 
...until now.
 
Within the past year, the fiery treasures hidden in the mountains were
remembered, and work began on the systematic mining of the places where
they had been found.  Today, aided by the magicks of master magi and
sorcerers throughout the realms, a set of "arcane apparatus" designed
specifically for the most advanced magical practitioners has been created.
 
Should a well travelled wizard acquire a complete set of such apparatus,
it is said powerful magics will be imbued into their being.

One thing that nearly every great warlord has in common with their

From this school of thought was the Blacksteel Battlegear created.
 
Forged by the finest smiths for the finest warriors, the armour is said

L: 1
E:
Upon reaching level 10, your character will be able to access their
"vault".  These vaults are a place where you can store items or gold
and provide access to said items or gold to other characters whom
you specify.
 
Remember, just like your password, it is $Bimportant$R to KNOW who
you have allowed to access your vault.  The Immortal staff is NOT 
responsible for vaults that are looted by dishonest sorts that you
have granted access to your vault.
 
All vaults come with a base of 10 times (your level).
At level 11, that means your vault can hold 110.
 
Additional storage can be purchased at the vault salesman as indicated
on the map of town. (see $Bhelp MAP$R)
 
The vault salesman sells additional personal vault space, clan vaults
(initial purchase), and additional clan vault space.
 
Any gold stored in your vault is separate from your bank gold, and
unlike gold in the bank, can be accessed by anyone who can use your
vault.
 
Vaults can be used and accessed in any safe room in the game.
Additional vault space can only be purchased at the salesman.
 
The syntax for using vaults is as follows:
 
 $Bvault <list | balance> [name of vault owner]$R
   - Lists the items or balance of gold in specified owner's vault.
     (no name specified defaults to your own)
 
 $Bvault <put | get> <object> [name of vault owner]$R
   - Adds or removes items from the specified owner's vault.
     (no name specified defaults to your own)
 
 $Bvault <deposit | withdraw> <amount> [name of vault owner]$R
   - Adds or removes gold from the specified owner's vault.
     (no name specified defaults to your own)
 
 $Bvault access [name to add/remove access]$R
   - Adds or removes access to your vault of specified names.
     (use once to add a name, again to remove)
 
 $Bvault myaccess$R
   - Provides a list of all persons who have granted YOU access
     to THEIR vaults.
   - Typing "$Bvault myaccess [name]$R" will remove your access from
     someone else's vault that you could previously access.

 $Bvault log <clan>$R
   - Provides you a list of several of the most recent transactions
     in your vault. (Allows you to see who added/removed items.)
 
 $Bvault search [keyword <keyword>] | [level <level>] | ...$R
   - Allows you to search a vault for items containing a specific
     keyword and out puts them in a sytle similar to "vault list".
   - A level or level range may be indicated.
   - Examples:
      vault search keyword staff

      vault search keyword staff keyword black level 40-60
 
Enter "$Bvault$R" without any arguments to see a list of the
available commands.
 
$BNote regarding CLAN VAULTS$R (see also: $Bhelp CLAN VAULTS$R)
When accessing your clan vault simply use the word "clan" in place
of a player's name.  more information is found in the clan vault helpfile.
 
Example: vault put etala clan
 
$BNotes on special item types:$R
 - NO_TRADE items can be put in your OWN vault and ONLY removed by you.
 - No more than one UNIQUE item can be in any one vault at a time.
 - NO_SAVE items and KEY items cannot be placed in vaults.

Noticing your look of confusion he continues, "I am trying to find my way,

home of all who would bring peace and justice to the world, the entrance
is a stair of pure light clouded in butterflies - true beauty and peace my

to reach the topmost tower of the castle will likely be devoured by the
powers of Good its-self, manifested in its physical form.
 
This is no area for very inexperienced adventurers.  For many it is a haven,
for others a doom. Go with a light heart and a steady arm and may whatever
God you pray to, cast their blessings upon you."
 
$B$0Suddenly the old man spins and waves his arms wildly, causing you to wonder
at the state of his sanity, and the reliability of his words.$R
 
Foaming at the lips and with a wild look in his eyes the old warrior screams
at you "SHE IS IN THE TOWER, ALONE FOR ETERNITY!".  His voice becomes suddenly
calm and quiet, and he whispers "she waits for you to free her, do not make
her wait too long!"
 
The young Paladin who came to you watches as the old man walks away before
commenting, "I worry for his state of mental health, but having no other
information i shall trust his words. Fare well noble adventurer, may we meet
again where the sprites and fairies play, and the maidens flirt freely."
 
$B$0With a small salute and a turn of the heel he walks away slowly, leaving you
to wonder what will become of him and this mysterious castle.$R

A familiar paladin approaches, though he is not nearly as
replendescent as usual.  His armor torn and battered and it is
difficult to distinguish his heraldry due to the beating he has
apparently absorbed...
 
$B$0His voice is quiet, and his breathing shallow:$R
 
"Noble adventurer we meet yet again! Not in the grand setting I
had imagined, however. I took a wrong turn in my journey and
found myself in the Castle of Dark, there was no. . . "
 
$B$0He breaks off suddenly as a look of pain crosses his face.$R
 
"There was no mercy to be found there, the warriors and knights
cared not to parley so intense was their hatred for goodness.
Even the chef attacked me!"
 
$B$0Spasms wrack his body and blood spurts from his mouth as he coughs.$R
 
"I should have known I had strayed from my path, The Castle of
Dark is guarded by a gigantic leech, my weapons could not harm it
- if you travel that path I encourage you to use your skills and
any offensive spells you have, fighting barehanded worked well,
perhaps you can find a weapon to harm the creature."
 
$B$0Another spasm passes slowly, it is obvious this proud paladin is
nearing to death's door.$R
 
"My friend, the castle is in ruins, the tunnels and caves connect
everything together, pitfalls and ropes are all that allow travel
from level to level, and the darkness. . . the castle is aptly
named, I know not what happened but thet castle is cursed, if you
go remember bring a light or glowing equipment, beware the Dark
Cleric and be on the lookout for the many secret doors. This is no
place for the very inexperienced, and some of those who rule the
castle, like the wicked Temptress and Shalyte, are too strong even
for an entire group!"
 
$B$0He coughs a goodly amount of blood, a sure sign he is close to 
expiring.$R
 
"My friend i would warn you away from the lower levels, they have
no love for good hearted creatures and will attack on sight. Only
a protection from evil spell has any hope of saving you.  If
you go, search along the southern branch of the Forest Road west of
Sorpigal.
 
Here you will find the leech. Avenge me if you can, spare yourself
if you cannot. I wish you well in your adventures, remember me my

E:
$B$0An elder monk from a nearby monastery approaches you beckoning...$R

"Come young grasshopper, come sit by my side and meditate on some of this 
herb lore I scored from Fret Falconhand while I tell you the history of the 
Brotherhood.  Long before the breaking of the Tir, the Brotherhood of the 
Monks existed merely as a wandering sect of clerics that sought 
enlightenment in the farthest reaches of the realm.  They soon learned that 
their practice of non-violence would not allow them to live long enough to 
pursue their goals and began to develop a means to defend themselves without 
wielding weapons.  They turned their bodies into living weapons.  As the 
ages passed, knowledge of the clerical arts was forgotten and what remained 
were fighters that forsook weapons and the impediments of heavy armor.
 
Lightning fast and difficult to hit, monks are a fighting class, unique in 
that they also utilize ki to augment their prowess [$BSEE HELP KI$R].  A 
formidable class, monks make excellent tanks, can contribute to most groups, 
and solo effectively [$BSEE HELP GROUP$R and $BHELP TANK$R].  To get started you'll 
want to pay a visit to Sahmot Notrem in the monks guild.  While he may not 
be able to impart the Three-legged Dog Pissing Stance or the Hairy Palm 
Style, he can teach you a variety of skills that make a monk formidable [see 
$BHELP PRACTICE$R].  If he should not know of the knowledge you seek, he may 
send you on a $BSKILL QUEST$R with a clue.  Usually there is enough of a hint in 
the clue to figure out where you need to go by looking at $BHELP AREAS$R.  If 
you find yourself stumped try using the newbie channel or asking a guide for 
help [see also $BHELP GUIDE$R].
 
You'll find Sahmot in the monk guild.  From the Albatross Tavern travel 
$Bsouth, 6 west, 2 north$R.  Above the tavern you will find the $BMud School$R which 
is a good place to start gaining experience.  Exploration of the school's 
halls will also yield some beginner equipment and items.  You'll find the 
diploma is useful for leveling [see also $BHELP GAIN$R].  Once you familiarize 
yourself with the Mud School you can try your luck at the Mushroom Caverns, 
Kilderry, or the Great Tree.  HELP AREAS will provide a list of other areas 
you might try exploring.
 
You may find equipping your monk frustrating because of their need for light 
and loose-fitting armor.  As a fighter class, look for equipment that gives 
bonuses to hit and damage, while lowering your armor class.  Equipment that 
gives a bonus to ki is also good.  The $Bnewbie channel$R or asking guides are a 
good way to ask about what equipment is good for your class and level.
 
Once you find information on useful equipment, you can use the auction
channel to try and purchase it from another player.  Alternately you can try
to get a GROUP together to run some equipment [see also $BHELP AUCTION$R].
 
When gaining a new level at your guild, you'll definitely want equipment 
that gives bonuses to your stats [see also $BHELP GAIN$R].  Your $BCONSTITUTION$R 
will determine how many hit points you gain upon leveling and your hit point
and movement regeneration rates [see also $BHELP CON$R and $BHELP REGEN$R].  $BWISDOM$R 
is important in determining the number of practices you gain upon leveling.  
$BINTELLIGENCE$R determines how well you progress in your proficiency of a skill 
or spell with each practice.  Stat points also determine how proficient you 
may become in a certain skill [see $BHELP MONK$R to view which skills are 
dependent upon which stats].
 
Each stat, and virtually any other topic on Dark Castle has its own help 
file.  You can use the $B$4INDEX command$R to effectively list the available files 
[see also $BHELP INDEX$R].  Some basic information to get you on the road can 
also be found in many of the helpfiles geared for new players such as:
  $Bhelp NEWBIE, help GETTING STARTED, help NEWBIE AREAS, help NEWBIE EQ$R
 
Additionally, you will also find that each skill has its own separate help 
file.  Some are more useful than others so you might want to conserve your 
practices for useful but less used skills while gaining proficiency through 
use the skills more often used [see also $BHELP LEARN$R and $BHELP IMPROVE$R].
 
I hope this is enough information to get you started upon the path to 
Enlightenment.  If you have any questions feel free to ask or use the newbie 
channel.  Just remember that answers from those without $B(GUIDE)$R before 
their names might not provide truthful answers.  Now young grasshopper, all 
there is left to do is for you to snatch this pebble from my hand."
 
$B$0The monk wanders off, chuckling softly to himself about silly youngsters.$R

The players of Dark Castle are well known for their perpetual need to
measure their....abilities and argue about who is the "best".  To this 
end, there exists the $B"Champion Flag"$R.
 
Each reboot the Champion Flag item will load in Stonewitch, which is
the center of Sorpigal, the primary city within Dark Castle.  The
first player to pick up this flag becomes the "Champion" and this is
indicated by a global message to all players.
 
While carrying the "Champion" flag the player will receive $B10%
additional experience points$R from any mobs he or she slays.
 
The player who is the Champion will remain the champion as long as
he or she is not defeated in battle by another player or logs out.
 
Should the Champion be defeated in battle the flag is automatically
moved over to the victor who then becomes the new Champion as is
indicated by a global message.
 
The Champion is $Bunable to enter$R any clan or guild room and will
not be safe in $Bany$R safe room (essentially is affected by a
CANTQUIT).
 
The Champion flag can only be earned via victory in battle and once
acquired cannot be stolen, given, dropped, or otherwise transferred.
 
Should the Champion feel he is no longer up to the task of being the
champion he can yield the flag by donating it from a safe room. It will
reappear in Stonewitch. He can only do this if he doesn't have a CANT_QUIT
or PTHIEF flag.
 
or
 
Should the Champion log out, the flag will reappear in Stonewitch after
a brief delay for a new Champion to pick up and acquire.
The current "Champion" can be easily identified via the "WHO" command.
Now get out there and see if you "measure up" to the Champion!

QUEST SKILLS, SKILLS, RANGER, PRACTICE, SKILL QUESTS
L: 1
E:
Rangers, through their intense study and experience dealing with the myriad
of habitats and creatures of the realms, have built up a tremendous store of
knowledge about the many races within the world.  The most veteran of the
class have honed this skill to a point where they are able to effectively
exploit the weaknesses they have discovered in combat.
 
This skill is called "$BNatural Selection$R".  The skill allows a ranger to choose
a specific race upon which to focus their abilities and thus be both significantly
more successful in striking creatues of the chosen race in combat and deal
additional damage as a result.
 
To focus their skills the ranger need only "$Bselect$R" the race he or she intends
to combat.  As this does require a fair amount of focus and skill on the part
of the ranger, there will be a period of time before the ranger can change their
selected race.
 
The races the ranger is aware of to choose from are as follows:
 NPC       Human      Elf      Dwarf      Hobbit      Pixie
 Ogre      Gnome      Orc      Troll      Goblin      Reptile
 Dragon    Snake      Horse    Bird       Rodent      Fish
 Arachnid  Insect     Slime    Animal     Plant       Enfan
 Undead    Ghost      Golem    Elemental  Planar      Demon
 Yrnali    Immortal   Feline
 
  syntax: select <race>
 
Note that both the additional skill with which the ranger combats a selected
race and the time in which the ranger must wait to select a new race both
improve commensurate with the ranger's skill level.

$B$0An unsealed document has been entrusted to your care for delivery.
Your curiosity piqued, you open the document to find...$R
 
Mayor Flinn,
 
You once joked about the Hobgoblins going to war against the Gnome Village 
under the pretext of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs).  Your words may 
have come back to haunt you.  While intelligence is spotty at best I
suspect that Cantus has unleashed a WMD upon the Apiary northwest of
Sorpigal.  Rumor has it that the bees have grown to monstrous sizes and
have seized control of the Apiary.  Workers not paralyzed by fear have
found their roles reversed and now labor for the hive, at least as much
as their panic and terror allow.  My own initial investigation shows that
everything is normal outside of the Apiary walls, with normal sized bees
and vacationing Sorpigalians hardly a match for a group of novice
adventurers.  The highly aggressive defense of the hive by the mutated
bees will most likely require great stealth or invisibility.
 
Regardless of whether this attack was chemical or magical, this may
explain why Cantus has done little to organize the minotaurs.  It also
begs the question of what else he has planned.  This problem is escalating
quickly.  The all-seeing Odin has dispatched a Valhallan ambassador who
insists that this be resolved immediately.  He also intimated that we may
not like the results should Thor be dispatched to keep the honey flowing
for their mead production.  While the guard is spread thin to protect
against possible hobgoblin and minotaur incursion, might I suggest a
bounty be offered to any ambitious adventurers willing to resolve this
sticky problem.
 
Your humble servant,
 
Janikhel

trip to the Apiary could prove most profitable...$R

E:
So you were dumb enough to play a barbarian.  Luckily for you barbarians 
arent known for their wits.  This fighter class is the embodiment of
hack and slash.  Youll want to start by finding the $BBarbarian Guildmaster$R,
Berkthgar, so you can learn $BDual Wield$R at level 1 [see $BHELP DUAL WIELD$R].
A number of other skills are available to the barbarian at lower levels as 
well.  While Berkthgar can teach most of what you need to know, he may send 
you on a $BSKILL QUEST$R with a clue if he does not have the knowledge.  Usually 
there is enough of a hint in the clue to figure out where you need to go by 
looking at $BHELP AREAS$R.  If you find yourself stumped try using the $Bnewbie 
channel$R or asking a guide for help [see also $BHELP GUIDE$R].
 
At the guildmaster, type:  $Bpractice dual wield$R [see also HELP PRACTICE]
 
From the Albatross Tavern, the barbarian guild is $B1 south, 4 east, 1 north$R.
 
To $BGAIN$R levels youll need to earn experience points.  A good place to start 
is the $BMud School$R which is located above the Albatross Tavern.  Exploration 
of the school's halls will also yield some beginner equipment and items.  
You'll find the diploma is useful for leveling [see also $BHELP GAIN$R].  Once 
you familiarize yourself with the Mud School you can try your luck at the 
Mushroom Caverns, Kilderry, or the Great Tree.  HELP AREAS will provide a 
list of other areas you might try exploring.
 
While barbarians tend to have a fair bit more hit points than other classes, 
ceteris paribus, they arent the best at soloing.  Foregoing tactics and 
strategies, barbarians tend to just wade into melee inflicting as much 
damage as possible.  This also frequently leaves them open to attack.  With 
this in mind, barbarians tend to be better in a melee support role in a 
group but can service as a tank in a pinch [see $Bhelp GROUP$R and $Bhelp TANK$R].

 
As far as equipment goes, youll want to look for equipment that boosts your 
$Bhit and damage$R.  With poor defensive skills and designed to punish others 
with their physical prowess, equipment that lowers your armor class is not a 
high priority, while equipment that boosts your $BHIT POINTS$R, $BSTRENGTH$R, or 
$BCONSTITUTION$R is an added bonus.  Once you find information on useful 
equipment, you can use the auction channel to try and purchase it from 
another player.  Alternately you can try to get a GROUP together to run some 
equipment [see also $BHELP AUCTION$R].
 
When gaining a new level at your guild, you'll definitely want equipment 
that gives bonuses to your stats [see also $BHELP GAIN$R].  Your $BCONSTITUTION$R 
will determine how many hit points you gain upon leveling and your hit point 
and movement regeneration rates [see also $BHELP CON$R and $BHELP REGEN$R].  $BWISDOM$R
is important in determining the number of practices you gain upon leveling.  
$BINTELLIGENCE$R determines how well you progress in your proficiency of a skill 
or spell with each practice.  Stat points also determine how proficient you 
may become in a certain skill [see $BHELP BARBARIAN$R to view which skills are 
dependent upon which stats].
 
Each stat, and virtually any other topic on Dark Castle has its own help 
file.  You can use the $BINDEX$R command to effectively list the available files 

[see also $BHELP INDEX$R].  Some basic information to get you on the road can 
also be found in many of the helpfiles geared for new players such as:  $Bhelp 
NEWBIE$R, $Bhelp GETTING STARTED$R, $Bhelp NEWBIE AREAS$R, $Bhelp NEWBIE EQ$R.
 
Additionally, you will also find that each skill has its own separate help 
file.  Some are more useful than others so you might want to conserve your 
practices for useful but less used skills while gaining proficiency through 
use the skills more often used [see also $BHELP LEARN$R and $BHELP IMPROVE$R].
 
I hope this is enough information to get you your blood flowing and your 
weapons swinging as you set upon a path of rampage and pillaging.  If you 
have any questions feel free to ask or use the newbie channel.  Just 
remember that answers from those without $B(GUIDE)$R before their names might 
not provide truthful answers.

E:
Clerics are well known for being among the few in the realms who
are capable of communicating directly with their god(s).  This
communication takes many forms, the foremost of which is of
course prayer.
 
There are occasions however, where the cleric requires assistance
above and beyond the spiritual and is forced to call for the
direct intervention of their god to save them from what otherwise
might be a painful and gruesome death.
 
This intervention is among the most powerful incantations a
cleric can cast as it, for a brief period of time, reduces ALL
damage taken by the cleric in battle to a mere single point.
 
This godly protection cannot be dispelled and, as such, is not
called upon lightly and can be used but once per day.
 
Furthermore, so utterly draining of the cleric's spiritual essence
is this incantation, for a time after calling upon this power, the
cleric will be unable to cast ANY spells for the duration of the
affect and for a brief period of time after the affect expires.
 
The gods are only willing to intervene on behalf of the casting cleric
and no other selected target.
 
Note also that because this power is a direct intervention of the
gods on behalf of the cleric, its ability CAN be used despite the
effects of some abilities like bash or trip.

"Holy warriors, hybrid fighters, the paladins of Dark Castle are one of two 
classes that are constrained by their alignment [see HELP ALIGNMENT].  
Should they stray from the path of good they will find themselves bereft of 
the spells gifted to them by the gods.  Drawing from the skill sets of 
warriors and clerics you'll be able to learn most of them from the Paladin 
Guildmaster, Boyle.  From the Albatross Tavern the Paladin Guildhall can be

Right from the start you can learn lay hands [see HELP LAY HANDS].  Merely 
present yourself before the Guildmaster Boyle and
 
     type:  $Bpractice lay hands$R [see also HELP PRACTICE]
 
A number of other skills are available to the paladin at lower levels as 
well.  While the melee skills will surely help in your travels throughout 
the realm, you'll find early spells like bless and cure light to be of 
benefit as well [see HELP CURE LIGHT and HELP BLESS].  For a list of all the 
skills and spells available to a paladin type HELP PALADIN.
 
Each spell, skill, stat, and virtually any other topic on Dark Castle has 
its own help file.  You can use the INDEX command to effectively list the 
available files [see also $BHELP INDEX$R].  Some basic information to get you on 
the road can also be found in many of the help files geared for new players 
such as:
 
     $Bhelp NEWBIE, help GETTING STARTED, help NEWBIE AREAS, help NEWBIE EQ$R
 
If by chance Boyle does not have the knowledge to teach you a spell or 
skill, he'll know someone who does and will send you on a $BSKILL QUEST$R with a 
clue.  Usually there is enough of a hint in the clue to figure out where you 
need to go by looking at HELP AREAS.  If you find yourself stumped try using 
the newbie channel or asking a guide for help [see also HELP GUIDE].
 
To gain levels youll need to earn experience points.  A good place to start 
is the Mud School which is located above the Albatross Tavern.  Exploration

You'll find the diploma is useful for leveling [see also HELP GAIN].  Once 
you familiarize yourself with the Mud School you can try your luck at the 
Mushroom Caverns, Kilderry, the Great Tree, or the Aerial Castle.  HELP 
AREAS will provide a list of other areas you might try exploring.
 
A paladin's melee skills and healing powers grant them a decent ability to 
solo as well as contribute in groups.  As their healing prowess increase 
they can take some pressure off of clerics or even stand in as the group's 
healer if ambitious or desperate [see help GROUP and help TANK].
 
When gaining a new level at your guild, you'll definitely want equipment 
that gives bonuses to your stats [see also $BHELP GAIN$R].  Your CONSTITUTION 
will determine how many hit points you gain upon leveling and your hit point 
and movement regeneration rates [see also HELP CON and HELP REGEN].  WISDOM, 
one of the paladin's requisite stats (the other being STRENGTH), is 
important in determining the number of practices you gain upon leveling.  It 
will also affect a paladin's mana regeneration rate.  INTELLIGENCE 
determines how well you progress in your proficiency of a skill or spell 
with each practice and WISDOM determines how many practices you receive
upon each gaining session.
 
Stat points also determine how proficient you may become in a certain skill 
or spell [see $BHELP PALADIN$R to view which skills and spells are dependent 
upon which stats].  Some are more useful than others so you might want to 
conserve your practices for useful but less used skills while gaining 
proficiency through use, the more often used skills [see also HELP LEARN and 
HELP IMPROVE].
 
Equipping a paladin can be a juggling experience as you can choose from 
bonuses to hit and damage, hit points, mana points, and stat points.  It all 
boils down to how you want to play as a paladin:  balanced, more a fighter, 
or more a healer.  The newbie channel or other paladins can be good 
resources for finding information about what equipment paladins can wear.  
Once you find information on useful equipment, you can use the auction 
channel to try and purchase it from another player.  Alternately you can try 
to get a GROUP together to run some equipment [see also HELP AUCTION].
 
I hope this is enough information to set you upon your journey of protecting 
the innocent and vanquishing evil.  Walk in the Light and welcome to Dark 
Castle.  If you have any questions feel free to ask or use the newbie 
channel.  Just remember that answers from those without (GUIDE) before their 
names might not provide truthful answers."

WARRIOR, SKILLS, PRAC, GETTING STARTED, INDEX, GUIDE
L: 1
E:
Finesse my boy, it's all about finesse.  While warriors may not have the 
initial upfront damage like thieves, the brute ferocity like barbarians, or 
the propensity of learning magical protection, they can deal their fair 
share of pain as they are adept at armed combat and can master all weapon 
types.  They also have a mixed bag of tricks in their melee repertoire which 
include turning your attacks against you, targeting your kidneys or your 
heart, and delivering a breath-taking blow to your solar plexus which will 
leave you stunned.
 
These skills don't come to a warrior all at once.  It takes practice and 
dedication before you can become a whirlwind of blades and death.  You can 
start off by learning kick from the warrior guildmaster, Hydel.  He'll be 
able to teach most of the skills that can be acquired by a warrior.  From 
the Albatross Tavern you'll find the warrior guild:
 
     $Bsouth, 3 east, south$R
 
Merely present yourself before him and type:
 
     $Bpractice kick$R [see also $BHELP PRACTICE$R]
 
A number of other skills are available to the low level warrior.  Double 
will allow you to increasingly attack twice in a round with your main weapon 
while headbutt will deliver a surprising blow to your opponent momentarily 
shocking them.  For a list of all the skills available to a warrior type 
$BHELP WARRIOR$R.
 
Each spell, skill, stat, and virtually any other topic on Dark Castle has 
its own help file.  You can use the $BINDEX$R command to effectively list the 
available files [see also $BHELP INDEX$R].  Some basic information to get you on 
the road can also be found in many of the help files geared for new players 
like: $Bhelp NEWBIE, help GETTING STARTED, help NEWBIE AREAS, help NEWBIE EQ$R
 
If by chance Hydel does not have the knowledge to teach you a skill, he'll 
know someone who does and will send you on a $BSKILL QUEST$R with a clue.  
Usually there is enough of a hint in the clue to figure out where you need 
to go by using the $BAREAS$R command.  If you find yourself stumped try using
the newbie channel or asking a guide for help [see also $BHELP GUIDE$R].
 
To gain levels youll need to earn experience points.  A good place to start 
is the Mud School which is located above the Albatross Tavern.  Exploration 
of the school's halls will also yield some beginner equipment and items.  
You'll find the diploma is useful for leveling [see also $BHELP GAIN$R].  Once 
you familiarize yourself with the Mud School you can try your luck at the 
Mushroom Caverns, Kilderry, the Great Tree, or the Aerial Castle.  The AREAS
command will provide a list of other areas you might try exploring.
 
As a melee class, warriors don't make bad tanks with their relatively higher 
hitpoints, ceteris paribus.  Their effectiveness as a tank will increase 
relative their mastery of skills like stun, parry, shield block, and 
riposte.  As far as soloing goes, they are not as effective as other classes 
as their damage is dealt over time and with no skill in healing other than 
being able to enhance their regeneration rate [$Bsee also HELP GROUP, HELP 
SOLO, and HELP REGEN$R].
 
When gaining a new level at your guild, you'll definitely want equipment 
that gives bonuses to your stats [see also HELP GAIN].  Your $BCONSTITUTION$R
will determine how many hit points you gain upon leveling and your hit point 
and movement regeneration rates [$Bsee also HELP CON and HELP REGEN$R].  $BWISDOM$R 
is important in determining the number of practices you gain upon leveling.  
$BINTELLIGENCE$R determines how well you progress in your proficiency of a skill 
with each practice.
 
Stat points also determine how proficient you may become in a certain skill 
or spell [see HELP WARRIOR to view which skills are dependent upon which 
stats].  Some are more useful than others so you might want to conserve your 
practices for useful but less used skills while gaining proficiency through 
use, the more often used skills [$Bsee also HELP LEARN and HELP IMPROVE$R].
 
A pure melee class, warriors do not have to take as much into consideration 
as other classes when it comes to equipment. As a warrior, you'll want to 
consider equipment that gives bonuses to: hit and damage, hit points, ac 
adjustments, and stat points ($BSTRENGTH, CONSTITUTION, and DEXTERITY$R).  The 
newbie channel or other warriors can be good resources for finding 
information on what equipment warriors can wear.  Once you find information 
on useful equipment, you can use the auction channel to try and purchase it 
from another player.  Alternately you can try to get a GROUP together to run 
some equipment [see also HELP AUCTION].
 
Well get along boy.  That should be enough information to set you upon your 
journey.  May your blade never dull and welcome to Dark Castle.  If you have 
any questions feel free to ask or use the newbie channel.  Just remember 
that answers from those without $B(GUIDE)$R before their names might not provide

L: 1
E:
The rumors behind the rise of the Druids are many.  Some say a lonely ranger 
had his way with an unsuspecting dryad.  Others believe there was an 
immaculate conception when a cleric pleasured herself with Piranha's Staff 
of Dismemberment.  Nonetheless the result was a caster with Nature at his 
beck and call.
 
A druid is not born into the full bloom of his elemental fury.  Like a tree 
needs air, light, and water to grow, a druid needs experience to cultivate 
his powers.  You can start off by learning blue bird from the druid 
guildmaster, Seamus.  He'll be able to teach most of the spells that can be 
acquired by a druid.  From the Albatross Tavern you'll find the druid guild:
 
 $B    9 south, west, 4 south$R
Merely present yourself before him and type:
 $B    practice blue bird$R [see also HELP PRACTICE]
 
A number of other spells are available to the low level druid as well.  The 
early spell set available to a young druid can be frustrating, but as the 
oak grows mighty in age, the druid's spells at later levels are quite 
powerful, making them a formidable opponent.  For a list of all the skills 
available to a druid type HELP DRUID.  However, take note that some of the 
druid spells are dependent upon the room environment.  The weather can also 
affect the spells available to a druid's disposal.
 
Each spell, skill, stat, and virtually any other topic on Dark Castle has 
its own help file.  You can use the $BINDEX$R command to effectively list the 
available files [see also HELP INDEX].  Some basic information to get you on 
the road can also be found in many of the help files geared for new players 
like:
$Bhelp NEWBIE, help GETTING STARTED, help NEWBIE AREAS, help NEWBIE EQ$R
 
If by chance Seamus does not have the knowledge to teach you a skill, he'll 
know someone who does and will send you on a $BSKILL QUEST$R with a clue.  
Usually there is enough of a hint in the clue to figure out where you need 
to go by using the $BAREAS$R command.  If you find yourself stumped try using

To gain levels you'll need to earn experience points.  A good place to start

you familiarize yourself with the Mud School you can try your luck at the 
Mushroom Caverns, Kilderry, the Great Tree, or the Aerial Castle.  The AREAS 
command will provide a list of other areas you might try exploring.
 
As a caster class, druids don't make for effective tanks with their 
relatively lower hit points.  Additionally their early spells are more 
effective in a defensive manner than offensive.  Their capability to heal 
and use stoneshield (level 20) makes them an effective support class in a 
group. [see also $BHELP GROUP, HELP SOLO, and HELP REGEN$R].
 
When gaining a new level at your guild, you'll definitely want equipment 
that gives bonuses to your stats [see also $BHELP GAIN$R].  Your $BCONSTITUTION$R
will determine how many hit points you gain upon leveling and your hit point 
and movement regeneration rates [see also $BHELP CON and HELP REGEN$R].  $BWISDOM$R
is important in determining the number of practices you gain upon leveling.  
Additionally $BWISDOM$R affects a druid's bonus/penalty to mana regen and spell 
concentration.  $BINTELLIGENCE$R determines how well you progress in your 
proficiency of a skill with each practice and also affects the chances of
automatically improving a spell or skill with use.
 
Stat points also determine how proficient you may become in a certain skill 
or spell [see $BHELP DRUID$R to view which skills are dependent upon which 
stats].  Some are more useful than others so you might want to conserve your 
practices for useful but less used skills while gaining proficiency through 
use, the more often used skills [see also $BHELP LEARN and HELP IMPROVE$R].
 
A pure caster class, druids need not be too concerned early on with 
equipment that gives bonuses to hit and damage.  If you're soloing you'll 
want to kill mobs in one or two spells.  And if you're in a group you'll 
probably be using most of your mana to keep the tank healthy.  Remember you 
regenerate mana much faster than hit points.  So you might consider starting 
out seeking equipment that contributes to your mana pool, regeneration 
rates, or stat points (WISDOM and INTELLIGENCE).  The newbie channel or 
other druids can be good resources for finding information on what equipment 
druids can wear.  Once you find information on useful equipment, you can use 
the auction channel to try and purchase it from another player.  Alternately 
you can try to get a GROUP together to run some equipment [see also $BHELP 
AUCTION$R].
 
That should be enough information to set you upon your journey.  May your 
tree holes be splinter free and welcome to Dark Castle.  If you have any

Anti-paladins are a dark and perverse lot With a penchant for taking putrid 
paramours. They are also one of two classes that are constrained by their 
alignment [see HELP ALIGNMENT].  Should they stray from the path of evil 
they will find themselves bereft of the spells gifted to them by the gods.  
Drawing primarily from the skill sets of thieves and mages, the majority
of the anti-paladin's repetoire can be learned from the Anti-Paladin
Guildmaster, Marrok.  
 
From the Albatross Tavern the Anti-Paladin Guildhall can be found:
 
     $B4 south, east, south$R
 
Immediately upon choosing the paths of darkness, the anti-paladin receives
the power to harmtouch [$Bsee HELP HARMTOUCH$R].
Merely present yourself before Marrok and enter:
 
     $Bpractice harmtouch [see also HELP PRACTICE]$R
 
A number of other skills are available to the anti-paladin at lower levels 
as well, but you may find the anti-paladin's more utile skills, such as 
$BBACKSTAB$R and $BVAMPIRIC TOUCH$R are not immediately available.  The number of 
melee skills and spells an anti-paladin receives early on are more than
enough to carry them to a point where they can acquire their more
"signature" abilities.
 
For a list of all the skills and spells available to an anti-paladin enter:
 
     $BHELP ANTI-PALADIN$R
 
Each spell, skill, stat, and virtually any other topic on Dark Castle has 
its own help file.  You can use the $BINDEX$R command to effectively list the

the road can also be found in many of the help files geared for new players 
such as: $Bhelp NEWBIE, help GETTING STARTED, help NEWBIE AREAS, help NEWBIE EQ$R
 
If by chance Marrok does not have the knowledge to teach you a spell or 
skill, he'll know someone who does and will send you on a $BSKILL QUEST$R with a 
clue.  Usually there is enough of a hint in the clue to figure out where you 
need to go by looking at $BHELP AREAS$R.  If you find yourself stumped try using 
the newbie channel or asking a guide for help [$Bsee also HELP GUIDE$R].
 
To gain levels youll need to earn experience points.  A good place to start 
is the Mud School which is located above the Albatross Tavern.  Exploration 
of the school's halls will also yield some beginners equipment and items.  
You'll find the diploma is useful for leveling [$Bsee also HELP GAIN$R].  Once 
you familiarize yourself with the Mud School you can try your luck at the 
Mushroom Caverns, Kilderry, the Great Tree, or the Aerial Castle.  HELP 
AREAS will provide a list of other areas you might try exploring.
 
The anti-paladin's melange of skills and spells grant them the ability to 
develop as a solo act quite well.  However, their utility in a group is
generally considered somewhat weaker than other classes unless they are
"tanking". [$Bsee help GROUP and help TANK$R].
 
When gaining a new level at your guild, you'll definitely want equipment 
that gives bonuses to your ATTRIBUTES [$Bsee also HELP GAIN$R].  Your
$BCONSTITUTION$R will determine how many hit points you gain upon leveling
and your hit point and movement regeneration rates at all times.
[$Bsee also HELP CON and HELP REGEN$R].
 
$BINTELLIGENCE$R, one of the anti-paladin's requisite stats (the other being 
$BDEXTERITY$R), is important in determining how well you progress in your 
proficiency of a skill or spell with each practice.  It will also affect an 
anti-paladin's mana regeneration rate.  $BWISDOM$R determines the number of 
practices you gain upon leveling.
 
Your attribute points also determine how proficient you may become in a
certain skill or spell [$Bsee HELP ANTI$R to view which skills and spells
are dependent upon which stats]. The helpfiles for $BHELP LEARN$R and 
$BHELP IMPROVE$R also give more insight into character development.
 
Equipping an anti-paladin can be a juggling experience as you can choose 
from bonuses to hit and damage, hit points, mana points, and attribute points.  
It all boils down to how you want to play as an anti-paladin:  balanced, 
fighter/thief focused, or more a caster.  The newbie channel or other 
anti-paladins are often a good resource for finding information about what 
equipment anti-paladins can wear.  Once you find information on useful 
equipment, you can use the auction channel to try and purchase it from 
another player [$Bsee also HELP AUCTION$R].  Alternately you can try to get
a $BGROUP$R together to run some equipment.
 
Welcome to Dark Castle, evil one.  If you have any questions feel free to ask

song, regardless of their prowess, you may find yourself tapping your toes 
and nodding your head, or desperately covering your ears.  Show no shame.  
Be loud and be proud baby!  A focus class that uses ki to power their songs, 
bards can be a frustrating class to play as they are unique in that many 
songs require a wind-up before the song's effect takes place [$Bsee HELP KI

the road can also be found in many of the help files geared for new players 
such as:  $Bhelp NEWBIE, help GETTING STARTED, help NEWBIE AREAS, help NEWBIE 
EQ$R
 
If by chance Lance does not have the knowledge to teach you a song or skill, 
he'll know someone who does and will send you on a $BSKILL QUEST$R with a clue.  
Usually there is enough of a hint in the clue to figure out where you need 
to go by looking at $BHELP AREAS$R.  If you find yourself stumped try using the 
newbie channel or asking a guide for help [$Bsee also HELP GUIDE$R].
 
To gain levels youll need to earn experience points.  A good place to start 
is the Mud School which is located above the Albatross Tavern.  Exploration 
of the school's halls will also yield some beginner equipment and items.  
You'll find the diploma is useful for leveling [$Bsee also HELP GAIN$R].  Once 
you familiarize yourself with the Mud School you can try your luck at the 
Mushroom Caverns, Kilderry, the Great Tree, or the Aerial Castle.  $BHELP 
AREAS$R will provide a list of other areas you might try exploring.
 
When gaining a new level at your guild, you'll definitely want equipment 
that gives bonuses to your stats [$Bsee also HELP GAIN$R].  Your $BCONSTITUTION$R, 
one of the bard's requisite skills (the other being $BINTELLIGENCE$R), will 
determine how many hit points you gain upon leveling and your hit point and 
movement regeneration rates [$Bsee also HELP CON and HELP REGEN$R].  
$BINTELLIGENCE$R determines how well you progress in your proficiency of a skill 
or song with each practice and through use.  It also determines a bard's ki 
regen rate.  $BWISDOM$R is important in determining the number of practices you 
gain upon leveling.
 
Stat points also determine how proficient you may become in a certain skill 
or spell [$Bsee HELP BARD$R to view which skills and songs are dependent upon 
which stats].  Some are more useful than others so you might want to 
conserve your practices for useful but less used skills while gaining 
proficiency through use, the more often used skills [$Bsee also HELP LEARN and 
HELP IMPROVE$R].
 
As for equipping a new bard, you'll probably want to choose from equipment 
that gives bonuses to ki and hitpoints.  You can also choose equipment that 
gives bonuses to stats and hit and damage.  However, in a group a young bard 
will be asked to rely on their songs, and if forced to solo a bard's 
offensive-based songs will usually produce more damage than their melee 
skills.  You'll also want an instrument as some songs cannot be used without 
holding one [$Btype PRACTICE$R to view those songs].  The newbie channel or 
other bards can be good resources for finding information about what 
equipment bards can wear.  Once you find information on useful equipment, 
you can use the auction channel to try and purchase it from another player.  
Alternately you can try to get a GROUP together to run some equipment [$Bsee 
also HELP AUCTION$R.
 
Welcome to Dark Castle, Sweety.  If you have any questions feel free to ask 
or use the newbie channel.  Just remember that answers from those without 
$B(GUIDE)$R before their names might not provide truthful answers.  Oh and if 
you happen to run into Elton John, tell that queen he ain't got nothing on 
me sugar!
 
$B$0With that, sh...err he...er it? saunters away swishing her..err hi..well

$B$0The Sorpigal Office of Tourism and Trade (SOTT) has provided the following 
information about the township of Kilderry...$R
 
Tired of the gritty streets of Sorpigal?
 
Adventures have you travel weary and footsore?
 
Then come to Kilderry for some rest and relaxation.  A newly renovated
farmhouse serves as a cozy bed and breakfast with the freshest beef,
mutton, and trout served daily.  Wander through rolling pastures to the 
south where free range livestock graze on lush naturally fertilized grasses. 
Neither hormones or steroids will be found in these beasts, their prized
meat sought far and wide, or as nearby as Sorpigal's own Juan.
 
Take a stroll through the nature preserve to the north where numerous game 
animals flourish.  But beware the wild boars and kestrels as they can be a 
bit feisty.  Not a hunter you say?  Then bring some apples to feed the ponies 
so highly prized by the dwarves of Ironforge.  Better yet, bring your fishing 
pole!  Whether on the banks of a placid lake or the wild river that feeds it 
SOTT guarantees you won't leave without catching the limit.
 
If you're feeling a bit more adventurous then try exploring the castle ruins 
beyond the woods or perhaps some spelunking in the caves beneath the cliff.
 
Whatever your desire, be assured that the town of Kilderry will go to the
utmost extreme to ensure that your stay will be the finest vacation experience
to be found in all the realms!

MEGAPHONE
OEDIT MEGAPHONE
NONE
NONE
NONE
OEDIT
L: 103
E:
A megaphone type object will announce a message to the room it is in.
It will not announce anything if carried, worn, etc, by any PC/NPC.
The message will be same as the extra description of what
you would normally see on an item when you look at it.
(in help oedit, look at lines 15 and 20 for more info on extra description)
 
A megaphone type item should be completely unseen by all mortals.
Therefore, it should have the NO_SEE flag:
 
It can have the NO_NOTICE and NO_LOCATE flags too, but these are
redundant with the NO_SEE flag.
 
It should NOT have the TAKE flag, so that it can not be moved.
 
After you change the item type of your new item to MEGAPHONE,
then the values of v1 and v2 will determine how often the message
is displayed to the room.
 
v1 is the delay time before the first message is displayed,
after the item is loaded.
For testing purposes, note that this timer starts as soon as
you load an item, not when you drop the item on the floor.
v2 is the delay time from the previous message to the next message.
 
Units of delay time in v1 or v2 are in 4 or 5 second increments.
(The code says 4 seconds, but actual time appears to be 5 seconds.)
 
So if you do: oedit v1 5
(Which means you will end up with: "Interval(v1): 5" )
 
Then you will see the first message about 25 seconds after you
load the item, assuming you drop the item before that time.
 
When the item loads on the floor to begin with,
(for example, on reboot or whatever)
it would simply display the message 25 seconds after loading.
 
If you also did: oedit v2 12
(Which means you will end up with: "Interval(v2): 12" )
 
Then the item would display the message again about a minute
later and repeat.
 
Values of 0 will default to equivelent of 1, for a 4 second delay.
 
You can disable the subsequent messages after the first,
by setting v2 to -1.  "oedit v2 -1"
This will result in the item displaying the message 1 time only.
 
You can disable the first message by setting v1 to -1. 
"oedit v2 -1"
This will result in the first message never showing, in which
case it won't matter what the value of v2 is.
 
I can't think of a reason why you would want to completely
disable a megaphone, what would be the point of having one
then?  But that doesnt mean there is no reason.  I just don't
have a scenario as an example right now.
 
Remember that megaphones can be used in combination with
mob/obj programs, which would start the timer at some point
when the item loads after the reboot, as a result of some
program, instead of starting right on the reboot.

The Meta-priest offers many exotic services through communion with
the gods.  Of course these services come with a price as the church has
many expenses (lawsuits and the like) to account for.
 
Should you wish to change your race or sex, the Meta-priest will commune with
the gods on your behalf and enact this change.
 
$B$4WARNING:$R Such a change should NOT be taken lightly as, once performed,
it $BCANNOT be undone$R save by another purchase.  Furthermore, regardless
of how much metaing has been purchased for your character's attributes,
$Byour attributes will be conformed to your new race's maximums$R.
 
Furthermore, the gods themselves require an additional sacrifice of:
$BTWO attribute points$R from EACH attribute$R.
 
  $BExample:$R
You are a human with maximum attributes (all 25s)....
If you converted to elf, your stats would be changed to:
  $B24 str, 25 dex, 23 con, 25 int, 24 wis$R and THEN receive a -2 penalty to each.
End result is your new stats would be:
  $B22 str, 23 dex, 21 con, 23 int, 22 wis.$R
 
Please note that there is a "CONFIRM" system in place with these purchases
so the gods will NOT reimburse you for screw-ups...select carefully!

TREASURE HUNT

QUEST, PRIZE, TOKEN, PRIZE ARENA, CC, VOUCHER, TRIVIA
L: 1
E:
From time to time, at the discretion of the Immortal staff, a special
"Treasure Hunt" may be started as a contest to retrieve prizes.
 
There will be global messages indicating the prizes and duration of the
treasure hunt as well as the name of the hunt if the Immortal running
it decided to give it a themed name.
 
Entering the command "HUNTITEMS" will allow you to see the list of
items distributed into the world and on what mobs they have loaded.
The mobs they load on are random and can be as easy a "1 hit kills" or
as hard as virtually unkillable.  It is totally random and the Immortal
running the hunt will not retrieve items for you that have landed on
a mob that is "too hard" for you to kill.
 
The hunt will automatically end when all the items have been retrieved
or when the time limit assigned by the Immortal running the hunt expires.
 
As you or your fellow players recover the prizes/items global messages
will indicate your/their success and the "HUNTITEMS" list is updated
accordingly.
 
Much like arenas and other fun contests, nagging an Immortal to run
a hunt is not a good way to encourage them to start one.
 
Information about some of the prize items available can be found in the
HELP PRIZES and HELP TOKENS helpfiles.  There are many other prizes
or items the Immortals may deem to run a Treasure Hunt for that are not
listed here.
 
Good luck and good hunting!
 
$B*$R Please note: Treasure hunts are a 100% original Dark Castle concept
and in no way related to any other MUD or online game, named or unnamed.
Any similarity to any idea from any other MUD or online game, named or
unnamed, is purely coincidental. - Thank You, the Management.

L: 105
E:
Level 105 and up Immortals have the ability to run a "Treasure Hunt"
for the players to enjoy.  Read "HELP TREASURE HUNT" for the details
on how these work from a player standpoint.
 
$BAdditional information about hunts for Immortals:$R
Much like PRIZE ARENAS, hunts should NOT be run for copious amounts of
powerful or highly sought after items or prizes.  Limit the number of
tokens or valuable prizes you start hunts for as it is the scarcity that
keeps the players intrigued and interested in participating in these
events.  (ie. a hunt or prize arena giving out more than 2 or 3 tokens
is too many)
 
The "golden brick" item is a good item to run a hunt for as these will
"morph" into prizes from a coded list of vnums, some valuable, some not.
 
$BThe syntax for starting a hunt is:$R
Syntax: huntstart <vnum> <# of items> <time limit> [hunt name]
 
The vnum is the "show" # of the item you are starting the hunt for.
The # of items is how many items will be in the hunt.
The time limit is how long the hunt will last before the items are removed.
The "hunt name" is if you want to give your hunt a spiffy name like:
  "the Super Duper Cool Hunt" or something (hopefully better :P).
 
Remember, like other prize and "fun" Immortal commands, its use is a
privledge, not a right.

CAN_SEE_PROG
L: 103
E:
This should work for both items and mobiles.
 
Add a CAN_SEE prog and use the new "mpretval" command to specify
whether or not the mob is visible (based on ifchecks, I guess).
 
for instance
 
if $$n.race == 5
  say I am the spirit of pixies, and thus you can see me.
  MPRETVAL true
endif
 
MPRETVAL false makes it NOT seen.
If neither of these are called (for instance, if a non-pixie called
the example prog above) it defaults to checking detect invis/hide/nosee
and crap like that.
 
if $$n.race == 5
  say I am the spirit of pixies, and thus you can see me.
  MPRETVAL true
else
  MPRETVAL false
endif
 
Would make the mob/item exclusively seen by pixies.
 
MPRETVAL doesn't do anything else yet outside of CAN_SEE_PROG's.

CANSEE
MPRETVAL MPIF MPCOMMANDS
L: 103
E:
CAN_SEE_PROG's expect an integer in the arg list, which will
be interpreted as a percentage.
 
The % is checked anytime the mud has to determine if a player
(or anything) can see the mob with the CAN_SEE_PROG.
 
For example, it would check % on room entry, on a look,
on a scan (if the mob is in the same room with the scanner)
when trying to give an item to the mob, or doing a social
that is interactive with the mob, or potentially lots of
other things.
 
With the following test prog on chain,
 
==============================
3>can_see_prog 20
say This is my new mob prog!
MPRETVAL false
==============================
We would get the following results.
 
For the sake of simplicity, we consider only looking at the room.
 
20% of the time, when looking at the room the prog would fire.
On these executions, because there is no if test in the
prog, it simply returns false for being able to "see" chain.
 
But, although you won't "see" chain, you will "hear" him:
Chain says 'This is my new mob prog!'
 
The other 80% of the time, when the prog does not execute,
the "false" is not returned...
So, chain would be visible as normal.
 
If you think about this carefully, this opens
up a huge realm of powerful possibilities.
 
Check help on MPRETVAL for more examples.
 
Holylite is the only thing that overrides "MPRETVAL false"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
==============================================================================
Following section applies to "web" mode.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$B$4It's always a good idea to list the progs for the mob or object you
are editing before you start the editor, regardless of your edit mode.$R

Go to:  https://www.dcastle.org/editor/
Note that you must include the "s" after "http", else
you will be redirected to the home page for the mud.
  
Login:
Use your immortal character name for username.
If lowercase on first letter does not work, use upper case first letter.
Password is the same as your immortal character password.
(Not the same as your shell account password, if you have one)
  
If your editor mode is currently "game", you will
be prompted to type"editor web" in the game.
After doing this, go back to the web page.  Click "reload" or "refresh".
This will show your options now that you are in the right mode.
  
In the game, enter the usual command appropriate to the content you
wish to edit.
  
For example, to edit a mob prog, enter:
"procedit <vnum> command <prog #>"
Your prompt will change to "Web Editor]".
While you have this prompt, go back to the
web page and click where it says click here. 
(This will reload the page, placing you in the editor.)
  
Edit your content as desired.  Submit when happy with your content.
While you are working in the editor, you may still perform actions
in the game, move, talk, check helps for some command, etc.
  
However, the only way to recover your normal prompt is
to either submit the content in the editor or abort.
  
If you make an error and simply wish to abort or want to abort for any reason,
you should first list the progs for the mob or object you are editing,
then switch to game mode with "editor game".

The result of this command will be dependent on if you had already clicked
"here" in the web page, or not.  If you did, then the game prompt switches
to the editor prompt, and you should do $B$2/s$R to $B$2save$R, $B$4not /a$R to $B$4abort.$R
/a to abort after already clicking "here" will delete the contents of that
prog.  But that's why you listed the progs before doing "editor game", so
you may still paste from the scroll back if needed.

If you did not already click "here" in the web page, then the previous version
of the prog should be preserved, and you should be returned directly to your
normal godly prompt.
  
If you have content in an aborted editor that you
want to save, be sure you copy it before you reload!

------------------
Note:
The only data you can set on a PLAYER is hitpoints, mana and move
(all of which are current, hence no permanent impact). 
This is because of the potential risks involved with allowing too much 
freedom with it.  If you want your mob to set any other data, tell an 
imp and it will be considered. 
   
Primary use of this is meant to be for mobs to modify themselves 
and mobs around them based on what happens after they've loaded.
Few examples,
Mob X gets stronger(higher damroll) the more damage it takes
When Mob Y dies his boss gets weaker.
And so on. ALOT of things are possible with this.

"Gangland eh?  What do you want to know about that slum?  Nothing there but a
bunch of punks and hoodlums that never graduated from Mud School.  They play at
being big time gangsters, calling themselves Ogres or Trolls.  My boy is a
patrolman. He says the vandals, bruisers, and dolls are getting more brazen
everyday. They'd probably wet their pants if they ever met a real ogre or troll.

"It'd be nice if that good-for-nothing mayor would clean up that rathole.   
His excuse about not being able to increase the number of patrolmen is a bunch
of hooey if you ask me.  Whoever heard of a smart hobgoblin?  What a load of
rubbish.

"But because the patrols are shorthanded, they won't eve go near the leaders'
hideouts these days.  I hear the leaders hide out at an abandoned warehouse
and an abandoned chapel.  Apparently they're breeding vicious pitbulls that will
attack any intruder on sight.  Damn mangy mutts.

"Well if you're still intent on nosing around that ghetto you'd best be careful
around those parts.  But if you happen to meet the leaders and take them out, I
hear they have some nice gear for a young whippersnapper such as yourself.

"Now get along and be productive.  Young folk these days, lounging around
doing nothing..."

NONE
GUILD, REDIT, RFLAG, RDELETE, SECTOR
L: 103
E:
The "Guild Flags" or "Class Flags" are available for builders to use
with permission from an Implementor or their supervising Immortal.

These flags will prevent all but the specificed classes from entering the
designated rooms.  Turning off all classes from entering a room will make
it accessible to "All".

The syntax is as follows:
$Bguild <room #>$R           - List all classes allowed in room
$Bguild <class>$R            - List all rooms that allow that class
$Bguild <class> <room #>$R   - Toggle allow/deny class in room
 
This can also have interesting applications for areas to prevent certain
classes from entering a part of a zone or a part of a quest/area/etc.

TEST PORT
TEST PROGS
'MOB PROGS', MPCOMMANDS, MEDIT, OEDIT, MPIF
L: 102
E:
This command will start or stop the mud on the test port, whatever
number that might be.  At the time of this entry, that is port 7000.

Syntax: testport <start I stop>

Purpose:
For authorized testers to be able to test mob progs, etc, even when a
higher level god is not available to manually start up the test port.

"testport stop" will probably not work from inside the test port,
so if you want to use the shutdown command to stop the test port,
be absolutuely sure that when you have multiple sessions open in
your client, that you are in are in the proper session/port before
issuing the shutdown command.

Alternatively, you can use the "testport stop" command from the
primary port.
Other reasons you would want to use the "stop" argument is if
the test port has froze up, etc, due to your mob prog infinitely
looping or whatever, so using the shutdown command in the test port
is not an option.

Note: Whichever port has progs that have been saved most recently,
      those progs will be what is used on the next reboot regardless
      of which port is booting.

      For example:
      You've got a prog set up on the main port, call it prog Z.
      You open the test port and login.
      You make some edits to prog Z for debugging purposes in the
      test port.  You save prog Z in the test port so you don't
      have to make the changes every time you boot it, since you
      are planning on testing over several days.

      This means when the main port reboots, the testing version
      is what will load there, even though the saves were made on
      the test port.  This might be a bad thing if there are things
      you would not want mortals to see, like your mob talking out
      of character when it's giving you debugging info.

      Or possibly more to the point, if you make prog Z on the test
      port to begin with, save it, and don't want it to be live on
      the main port...
      Be aware that it $Bwill$R be live on the main port.

TELEPORT, MPCOMMANDS, "IMM TELEPORT", RFLAG
L: 103
E:
Syntax: MPTELEPORT <victim> [area]

MPTELEPORT obeys the same laws of teleport as the cast version of the spell,
except that it will not have loss of concentration issues, since it is not
actually cast like a spell.

This means <victim> may be a literal mob name, or any valid variable from
the valid variable list, or a tempvar from MPSETTEMP or MPTHROW.

area is an optional keyword, if included the victim will land in the same
area they were in before the teleport.
without the "area" keyword, the victim could land anywhere.
Therefore, be sure to always use the area keyword argument when the
victim is or could be a PC, because its not cool to go around teleporting
worldwide. If victim is a mob, use caution and wise judgment when not
using the area argument.

There are mobs that teleport players to land anywhere, these are
exceptions to the rule due to the mob being very powerful.
GMOM and tarrasque for example.

Rooms with the $Bno_teleport$R flag will block landing in that room.
Rooms with the $Bteleport_block$R flag will block teleports from
starting in that room.

A primary example of how this might be used is to disperse mobs that have
collected in a room that was never meant to have mobs congregate there.

L: 1
E:
$B$6GENERAL INFORMATION:$R
 
In the Quester's Haven Inn in town you will find Phire, the Quest master.
For a price, he delivers clues to your character that you need to puzzle
out and resolve, returning to him a specified item.  Through completion
of such tasks, you earn "$B$7QUEST POINTS$R" (Qpoints in your score sheet).
 
$B$2Quest Cost$R:      The quests have been broken down into several categories
                 based upon difficulty and minimum level required to start
                 the quest.  The prices are as follows:
 
     $B$7Level                          Cost         Reward (Qpoints)$R
Automated quests$B$5*$R (random):        25 plats              1
Low level quests (<30):            50 plats              2
Mid level quests (30-59):         100 plats              4
High level quests (60):           250 plats              6
Group required quests (60G):     1000 plats + brownie   25
 
$B$7Note:$R Only the person who starts the group required quest will receive the 25
      qpoint reward upon completion of the quest.
 
$B$2Quest Timer$R:     Many of the quests have a time limit to complete the
                 quest.  Failure to complete the quest within the time limit
                 will result in a failed quest.  The quest will then be listed 
                 as available to be attempted again when you want to try again.
 
$B$2Quest Points$R:    Quest points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards
                 including equipment, experience, potions/wands by the various
                 town vendors.
  
$B$2Brownie Points$R:  Brownie points are a prize item that can be found in hunts or
                 won through various contests.  A brownie point is required
                 for the group-level quests to be started in addition to the
                 platinum cost. Brownies can be stolen, scrapped, and remain
                 in corpses.  As such, they should be guarded well.
 
 
$B$6QUEST COMMANDS:$R
 
$B$7The following quest commands may be used at any time or location:$R
 
$B$2Quest$R:          This command will display the list of quest commands with a  
                 brief summary of the commands' function.
 
$B$2Quest current$R:   This command will display all the pertinent information about  
                 a current ongoing quest.  This includes the quest name, hints  
                 for the quest, level requirements, and the time remaining
                 to complete the active quest..
 
$B$2Quest completed$R: This command will display all quests you have completed.
 
$B$2Quest canceled$R:  This command will display a list of quests you have canceled.
 
 
$B$7The following quest commands may only be used at Phire, the Quest Master:$R
 
$B$2Quest list$R:      This command lists quests available for a player's current
                 level.  Included information is quest name, cost, and reward.
                 $B$7Note:$R You will not be able to see quests that are set  
                       above your current level.
 
$B$2Quest cancel$R $B$7<quest name>$R: In the event that you think you are be unable to
                           complete a quest and would rather start a different
                           one, the quest cancel command will allow for the
                           quest to be canceled and completed at a later time.
                           $B$7Note:$R The quest fee is not refunded if the quest 
                                 cancel command is used.
 
$B$2Quest start$R  $B$7<quest name>$R: This command will start the given quest, provided  
                           that you have the required platinum and/or brownies.
 
$B$2Quest finish$R $B$7<quest name>$R: Upon finding and retrieving the item that Phire is 
                           looking for, return to him and use the quest finish  
                           command.  He will take the item from you, verify it
                           it is correct, and then reward you for your efforts.
 
$B$5*$7 Automated Quests:$R Unlike specifically named quests, "automated" quests simply
                    simply provide you the description (as in what you see when
                    you do a "look at" <target>) of a mob that you then have a
                    very short time to find, kill, and loot "a token of Phire".
                    The token should then be returned as normal for a reward.
                    Unlike other "named" quests, the automated quest option can
                    be completed as often as you choose.

Some procs/progs are also automatic and can occur whether or not there is a
pre-existing condition.  Most in-game quests or skill quests are proc driven.

When found, used, or cast, this affect can be employed in two capacities:

When released, offensive wild magic will cause a random aggressive affect to
fire at the selected target.  Similarly, defensive wild magic will cause a
random protective ability to fire at the selected target.
 
But be warned! There is always a small chance of an offensive use producing a
defensive effect and a defensive effect producing an offensive one!

$B$0You feel water splashing on your face...$R
 
"Urgh.. what.. what happened?"
 
You groggily try to sit up and realize you have a splitting headache,
and you begin to recall what happened...
 
Your canoe capsized when you were attacked by a kraken while sailing
the High Seas!  You were sure you were done for and going to drown! 
 
How are you still alive? 
 
You suddenly realize you are not alone and a pixie holding a fishing
pole is hovering near you examining you curiously.  Perhaps it wonders
if you count as a fish so he can brag to his friends later?
 
But then, it speaks!
"Ah! I see you are alive! Good! Good! I watched a mermaid drag you to
shore! I guess I should welcome you to Pridith, you seem luck to have
arrived still breathing air!", the pixie says.
 
$B$0Your head swims and vision fades as you black out once more...$R
 
Several days pass as you are nursed back to life by the fishermans
wife and you take some time to explore the kingdom.  Carefully explore
that is, as you try not to break your neck falling from the trees where
several of the pixies have made their homes. 
 
Youre amazed that a whole society of pixies has been here across the
sea and you hadnt even realized it!
 
They have a couple shops and even a school.  You have also viewed a
proclamation from the King warning away evil doers.  The sign made you
curious, because you havent seen any of the royalty out and about in
town since you arrived.  
 
You have however seen the entrance to the royal familys residence,
though the door is always locked. They do not seem allow humans to visit
their King.  Mind you, one of the servants is often seen hiding a key
under the doormat...
 
Perhaps it is to let in a lover to one of the princesses at night?
Or maybe to come back and steal valuables when the nobles have gone to
sleep!  Either way, you think it might be worth taking advantage of and
sneaking in to look around.  
 
Overall, your stay has been otherwise uneventful.  One exception being
the day you crawled down inside the tree to have a look around only to
find yourself stuck!  You could see that there used to be a spiral
staircase here, but it appears to have fallen into disuse and it would
be a bad idea to try to use. 
 
You decided it would be a good idea to call for help instead, and after
some time they gathered enough pixies to pull you out. It was at this
point that it occurred to you some rest and learning how to get home
might be in order.
 
After chatting with the pixie who rescued you for a while, you are 
able to determine approximately where the kingdom lies.  It seems that
if you went $Bs/7w/2s/e/s/e/2s/11w$R from the Albatross Tavern, you would
probably arrive near where you washed up.

Each of the valid types above has it's own associated helpfile.
Please refer to these helpfiles for more information on each
type of trigger.

Note that the first successful rand_prog and entry_prog is the only one 
which is executed.  All the successful greet (all) progs, speech_progs, 
and act_progs will be done. This is the best arrangement we found for 
handling situations where you imported several OBJprogram files for a 
object. If you are going to write lots of little files and piece them 
together to create the effect you want, it is advisable to not mix things 
together all that much, otherwise you have to pay close attention to the

L: 103
E:
Syntax: command_prog <argument>

Allows you to create softcoded commands, triggering progs based on
what players type in the room that has one of these items (Inventory/
equipment of person typing it also works).

Works well in conjunction with NO_SEE items, obviously.
Only usable variables at the moment are $n(person who typed it) or
$i(the temporarily created mob executing the oprog) and other 
variables based off of those two. 

The tempvar "lasttyped" gets set on the player executing it and it
contains the first word after "push"(or whatever command) so if you
type "push button bleh", lasttyped = button.

It defaults to ALSO executing the actual command, use "mpretval 
true" to disable that.

Example:

command_prog push
if tempvar($n[lasttyped])==button
say You pushed ze button.

The "vend sell" command allows you to post an item from your inventory
for sale at the Consignment Broker.  The item you post will be given a
"ticket number" for referral.  Your number of available tickets is equal
to the space in your personal vault/100.  Thus, meta'ing your vault
size will also increase the number of tickets you can use at once.
 
The seller is charged a total of 5% for any sale.  2.5% upon posting
an item for sale, and 2.5% upon collecting payment from any sold item.
 
Each sale has an maximum duration of two weeks, but may be removed
before expiration.  All items, be they $B$2ACTIVE$R, $4EXPIRED$R, or $B$0SOLD$R

Damar, control over the continent fractured between the numerous smaller
principalities.  Their internecine struggles only cooled with the appearance of
two rogue wizards who seek to control the continent's resources.  For the time

E:
The realms of Dark Castle are divided into several continents of varying sizes.
Each continent has its own set of areas that interact with both each other and,
at times, the other continents of the realms.
 
Travel between continents and areas on different continents has different
requirements than standard travel between areas.  This can range from increased
casting costs, to the outright prevention of magical travel.  All continents can
be reached via normal physical means (walking, ship, flying, etc.).
 
Some areas might not be continents in the "traditional" sense of the word, but
rather a group of secluded or difficult to access areas (i.e. The Underdark).
Each continent has a helpfile.  The list of current continents is as follows:
 
$B$3SORPIGAL$R - the largest continent of the realms and where new players begin.
           The central metropolis within this continent is called $BSorpigal$R
 
$B$3DIAMOND ISLE$R - a continent of medium size containing more difficult areas.
               The primary city of this continent is called $BNew Thalos$R.
 
$B$3KYU SHI'I KAZE$R - A continent of great danger for those of the utmost daring.
                 The hometown of this continent is named $BFar Reach$R
 
$B$3UNDERDARK$R - A series of underground areas spanning beneath several continents.
            There are few, if any, safe havens within these dark lands.
 
$B$3BEHIND THE MIRROR$R - A group of bizzare and unique realms that warp the
                    realities of space and time.  The $BParadise$R serves as a home
                    here, though offers little in the way of truly safe hideouts.
 
$B$3OCCORAN$R - The "Forbidden Island" a smallish continent where magics have run amok.
          There are no safe havens within its unchecked madness.
 
$B$3PLANES OF EXISTENCE$R - This "continent" encompasses areas within other planes of
                      existence, be they astral, elemental, or otherwise.
 
Please note that some of the helpfiles for the various continents are still under

Barbarians, not exactly known for their subtle nature, tend to often want to
visit places where they may not otherwise be welcome.  Places like, taverns
on "all you can drink mead night" or the bedroom of a particularly attractive
farmer's daughter.  As such, they frequently find locked doors baring their 
way.  However, to a true barbarian, this is rarely an impediment.
 
With a mighty crash of strength, a Barbarian is able to "batter" down a door,
enter the room, and permanently allow entry through the door until such a
time as repairs are able to reset it (meaning, it stays broken until repop).
 
This mighty burst of strength is not without cost as the Barbarian will
frequently sustain some small damage for his trouble.  In addition, a
Barbarian who is not sufficiently nimble, has a chance of bursting through
the door and falling into the room beyond!
 
$BBrace$R
Conversely, should the Barbarian be say, the owner of said tavern or the
father of said farmer's daughter, they may wish to keep others *out* and
prevent them from entering via a particular doorway.
 
The "brace" ability allows a Barbarian to hold fast a door and prevent entry 
to those on the other side as long as they remain in place.  While braced, a
door is considered both "closed" and "barred" and remains so as long as the 
Barbarian stays to hold it fast.

if the Thief is successful in making his or her escape, the direction their
departure takes them is hidden from those who may wish to do them harm and 
their ability to sneak remains uninterrupted.

Paladins, by virtue of their tremendous focus in battle and specialization
wielding mighty two-handed weapons, have the ability to smite their foes and
end their life in one mighty swing.  When a paladin is wielding a slashing
weapon that requires two hands, they are able to instantly slice their
victim's head clean off!
 
In order to land this finishing blow, the Paladin's foe must first actually
have a head.  Second, the Paladin's chances of a successful behead attempt
are influenced by both their opponent's condition (the more injured their
opponent, the more successful such an attempt will be) and the Paladin's own
alignment (the higher the Paladin's level of purity, the better the chances
of success).  Finally, the Paladin's level of ability in the behead skill
has, obviously, a significant impact on their chances for a kill.
 
In addition, once a Paladin's foe is sufficiently wounded to a point where
they are "covered in blood", the Paladin's chance of a successful behead
rises dramatically at a rate based upon their skill with two-handed wields.

This reputation for heroics is well earned and is often a result of a Paladin
harnessing his or her holy might in the form of the "Heroism" spell.
 
When cast prior to combat, this spell will provide the Paladin a significant
temporary increase to all of his or her skills.  The size of this boost 
reflects the level of skill to which the Paladin has learned this spell.
 
In addition, as the Paladin's heroic ability increases, he or she will gain 
an immunity to many of the ailments and afflictions cast forth by the forces 
of evil.  This includes immunities to Weaken, Fear, and Curse.

The Mage's superior understanding of the forces of magic permits them the
ability to instill magical energies into specially prepared objects.  One
of the more common varieties of such an object is the wand.  Wands are
generally imbued with a finite number of charges and expend a charge each
time the wand's magic is called forth.
 
If a Mage is of sufficient skill, he or she is able renew the magics in
many wands through the use of the "Imbue Wand" skill. This ability is a
combination of skill and magic, thus requiring a cost of both movement
and mana.  The mana cost is directly related to the actual casting cost
of the spell the Mage is attempting to imbue into the wand.
 
If successful, the targeted wand will be recharged a number of charges
related to the Mage's skill with Imbue Wand.  Each successful recharge
reduces the wand's maximum charges permitted by one. In the event of a
failed attempt, the wand will lose rather than gain a number of charges.
Beware, should a wand's charge fall below zero as a result of a failed
imbue attempt, it will be forever destroyed!
 
In addition, the Mage must be of a higher level than the wand they are
attempting to imbue and the attempt must be performed in a room where 
unsafe magic is permitted.

The most powerful and talented Mages have long been shapers and
manipulators of both magic and the elements of magic.  These talents
are clearly exemplified through an Elemental Filter.
 
The Elemental Filter skill allows a mage to modify the magic of many
offensive spells to use a wide variety of damage types. This
modification is automatically applied when the Mage casts a spell
and specifies a damage type that differs from the original.
 
As one might expect, this kind of modification also increases the
casting cost of the initial spell.  The chart below outlines both the
costs and relationship between magic types:
 
@--------------------------------------------------------------@ 
 
  Related Damage Types $B(R)$R - casting_cost * 1.5
Unrelated Damage Types $B(U)$R = casting_cost * 2
  Opposed Damage Types $B(O)$R = casting_cost * 2.5

$B$7Magic$R:  (R) Fire   |  (U) Cold   |  (O) Energy
 
@--------------------------------------------------------------@
 
These various damage types (related, unrelated, and opposed) become
available as the mage improves the Elemental Filter skill.
 
The Elemental Filter will work with most common offensive spells
within the Mage's arsenal.  Two notable exceptions are the Immolate
spell and spells with an area affect.  The filter cannot be applied
to spells casted via scrolls, wands, potions, or staves.

Anti-Paladins are reknowned for their sinister nature and malevolent ways.
This reputation for vile behaviour is well-earned and is often a result 
of an Anti-Paladin harnessing his or her unholy might in the form of the
"Villainy" spell. 
 
When cast prior to combat, this spell will provide the Anti-Paladin a 
significant temporary increase to all of his or her skills.  The size of 
this boost reflects the level of skill to which the Anti-Paladin has learned
this spell. 
 
In addition, as the Anti-Paladin's villainous ability increases, he or she 
will gain an immunity to many of the ailments and afflictions cast forth by 
the forces of good, including immunities to paralysis and blindness.
 
This spell may not be cast during combat and can affect only the caster.

Paladins, by way of their unspeakably holy and intensely honourable
nature, are able to bestow many unique blessings throughout the world.
These blessings can target people, creatures, objects, or even the
earth itself.  It is a Paladin's blessing of the earth that creates 
the magic of Consecrate.
 
Upon paying a cost of mana, movement, and a charge of holy water from
a container in his or her inventory, a Paladin will etch holy runes
upon the ground  nearby.  Once drawn, these runes may have one of 
three possible effects upon any nearby (in the room) beings:

   healing based upon how true to the cause of good they stand (the

$B2)$R However, those of an evil nature (any alignment below 0) are 
   pained greatly and receive injury based upon how far they have
   strayed from the path of good  (the closer to -1000 align, the
   greater the damage).
 
$B3)$R Those of a truly neutral standing (0 alignment exactly) remain
   completely unaffected by any consecration.
 
Depending upon the Paladin's skill, consecrations last for a very
short to a brief period of time.  The size of area a Paladin is able
to consecrate (number of rooms) is also directly related to his or 
her ability.
 
Any consecration is readily visible to those affected by powerful
magics used for the detection of good and may be destroyed utterly
through the use of magics for dispelling good.  More than one
Paladin may have a consecration active in the same room, however
a single Paladin may only have a maximum of one active consecration
per room.

Consecrate may not be used in any room that has been deemed "safe"
by the gods or belongs to a clan or guild.  Consecrate will also
fail completely if it is attempted in a room that has already been

Among the Druid's arsenal of powerful natural magics is the ability to 
call forth a furious storm of ice and cold upon his or her enemies.
 
Unlike many traditional magics that affect a wide area, the Druid is able
to tightly control the scope and range of the deadly storm and target it 
to a localized area.  As such, only the enemies of the Druid and his 
comrades will be subject to this deadly gale and friends and any nearby 
innocents are spared its chilly wrath.
 
In addition, should the victims of this frigid storm fail to
adequately resist its magical might, they will be "chilled" and suffer
a penalty to their Strength (STR) for a brief period of time.  Both
the amount of injury caused by the storm and the changes of successful
"chilling" of the Druid's enemies are directly related to the Druid's
skill with this powerful spell of nature.
 
As the magics used to cast Icestorm draw upon the Druid's natural
surroundings, this spell is less effective underwater or in a desert
climate.  It is however, significantly more effective in a tundra or
arctic environment.

Resulting from their familiarity with all things natural, be they
roots and plants, animals and insects, or forest and sea, Druids have
developed the ability to distill certain substances found in nature
into rare and unusual elixirs.  When consumed, such potions have been
known to enact a variety of beneficial, interesting, or potentially
dangerous results.
 
Brewing a potion is a tedious process and as such, may only be
successfully performed but once per day.  A failed brewing attempt
simply results in the spoiling of the container and herbal
ingredients and a used charge of the liquid ingredient.  However,
another attempt can be made again immediately afterwards.  The
Druid's brewing skill level determines his or her chance of a
successful brewing attempt.
 
In order to successfully brew a potion, a Druid requires three
essential ingredients:
 - an empty vial or bottle of varying rarities for holding their brew
 - an herb specially foraged by a Druid or Ranger
 - a liquid container with an appropriate type of liquid
 
It is a combination of these three items that is used to formulate
a specific recipe for a specific potion type.
 
$BVials/Bottles:$R
The quality of container employed by the Druid is the primary factor
that determines the power of the spell a potion contains.  In all,
there are five specific types of container, each more rare than the
last, that can be used to create a potion.  These specialized items
can be found randomly on the remains of beings slain throughout
the world.  Varieties include: crude, plain, refined, fancy, and
superior.  The best of these are a rare find indeed!
 
$BLiquids:$R
There are three varieties of liquid in particular that are preferred

There are many kinds of herbs that can be foraged by Druids and

Best known for their ability to heal, protect, and augment their
comrades through the use of holy magics, Clerics are often called
upon to cast a spell multiple times upon multiple allies.  This is
a process that is both draining and time consuming to the Cleric
and takes away from time that could otherwise be spent with altar
bo..err praying.
 
As such, a Cleric has the ability to "Commune" closely with their
god and call down a variety of magics simultaneously upon multiple
persons in his or her group.  This ability can be utilized by
casting a spell targetted at the Cleric's "group" (keyword group).

Clerics are exceedingly familiar with the ways of their respective
gods and the scriptures that accompany their beliefs.  As a result of
years spent at study, Clerics are adept at both reading and writing.
This aptitude has further manifested itself by way of allowing a
suitably prepared Cleric to scribe his or her holy words and magic
onto scrolls that can be recited to great effect.
 
Scribing a scroll is a tedious process and as such, may only be
successfully performed but once per day.  A failed scribe attempt
simply results in the spoiling of the scroll and the ingredients
involved in its creation.  However, another attempt can be made again
immediately following such a failure.  The Cleric's scribing skill
level determines his or her chance of a successful scribe attempt.
 
In order to successfully scribe a scroll, a Cleric requires four
essential ingredients:
 - a blank page of papyrus of varying rarities for writing upon
 - one of several possible writing utensils for scribing the words
 - one of several possible pots of ink for writing
 - one of several jars of dust for finishing and drying
 
It is a combination of these four items that is used to formulate
a specific recipe for a specific scroll type.

As wildnerness experts, Rangers are called upon to know their way
through the wilds and rough terrain of the world at large.  They are
at home in this kind of environment and find little use for the noise
and clutter of cities and traditional civilization.
 
So at home in the wilderness are they, that Rangers have the ability
to find refuge in even the most untamed of locales.  Ranger possess
the unique skill of "making camp" in nearly any traditionally unsafe
region of the world.
 
Once a Ranger has located and successfully settled into a camping
spot, the area is considered "safe" for any who may wish to
rest or sleep while avoiding many of the dangers associated with the
open road.  While not suitable for making a "home", regeneration for
any travelers and their followers using the site is as beneficial as
even the most secure guild or clan hall.
 
The security of a campsite is broken if the Ranger who has made camp
leaves the site, or whenever an untamed creature (non-charmed mob)
enters the room.  As well, unlike traditional "safe" locations, being
in the campsite does not prevent combat from taking place.  Though
protected from theft and the aggression of wild creatures, others may
enter and commit an act of violence.  This will destroy the sanctity
and safety of the campsite, ending its affects.
 
In addition, as it is common to post a lookout and keep an eye for
danger when in the wilderness, any in the confines of the campsite
also gain the "farsight" to see those who may be approaching and
threaten their rest.
 
Rangers may make camp in nearly any region save cities, roads, safe
rooms, fall rooms, or unstable areas.  In addition, no camp can ever
be created should an untamed creature (mob) be present at the site.

Warriors who have chosen a strict military path, specifically that
of the Legionnaire, are often called upon to serve as the vanguard
and forefront on the battlefield.  As a result, such brave
fighters have learned to inspire their followers both offensively
and defensively to new heights in battle.
 
When leading a group, the Leadership skill grants the Legionnaire
a significant bonus to both their hit and damage capabilities. In
addition, members of a group said hero is leading will receive a
significant bonus to their armor class.
 
Both bonuses are dependant upon the number of group members.  The
greater the number, the more significant the bonus.  Note however
that once a Legionnaire-led group reaches a totale of five
followers, the total bonus will not increase further.
 
The Legionnaire's skill with Leadership also plays a role in the
size of the armor class bonus any followers receive. Furthermore,
should followers leave the presence of the group or subsequently
return, the bonus granted will increase or decrease accordingly.
Charmed creatures and other non-sentient beings are regrettably
uninspired by any Legionnaire's leadership capability.

As a rule, theives rarely like to sit in the same place for long and
the Pilferer profession is no exception to this rule. This could be
in part related to the unseemly pursuit that seems to result from
the stealing of someone's goods or hard-earned money.
 
Pilferers, relying primarily upon speed and stealth, have not only

mastered the stealing arts, but also the art of striking their
victims quickly and retreatly equally as fast.  The quickstab ability
is the culmination of these abilities.
 
With quickstab, a pilferer will deliver a traditional backstab or
dual backstab upon their victim but suffer only half of the usual lag
that accompanies such an attack.  As a result, the damage this stab
delivers is reduced in proportion.

Clerics are generally regarded as the most adept in any form of faith-
based magic.  Their powers are known to confound, convert, injure, or
perform any number of miraculous acts.  Many clerics, particularly
those who follow the profession of Zealot, are known to be fanatical
about their faith well past the point of reason.  Some even firmly
believe that any sound, no matter how minute, is an interruption of
their devotion to their god.
 
As a result, Zealots have developed a powerful intercession commonly
refered to as the Silence spell.  This spell will enforce a holy quiet
upon a total area, including even the cleric themself.  When entering
this area of absolute silence, all forms of magical casting as well as
traditional communication are quite impossible.  The only effects able
to penetrate this powerful silence are ki abilities as these actions
are based upon an internal focus, working through a form of magic that
is foreign to the gods and more traditional casting.
 
The Silence spell can be cast either in or out of combat.  However,
due to the powerful nature of this enchantment, it lasts for but a
very short period of time.  Once expired or when an affected person
leaves the magically silenced area, their ability to cast and speak
immediately returns to normal.

  In addition to the physical world are several planes of existence that are
home to gods, souls, thoughts, memories, psychic energy, and other strange
denizens.  These planes touch the physical world in many places which can allow
travellers to take shortcuts across the land.  Beware though, these linkages
can lead to both benign and perilous places.

   It is said that long ago the island nation of Occoran thrived as a favorable
port of call.  That is until a mysterious man arrived.  Engaging and beguiling
he made promises of great wealth, power, and immortality -- and many believed
him.  As people began to disappear, and strange and horrific creatures began to
turn up, the denizens turned against each other, those in favor for the
stranger and those against.  By then it was too late as a devastating calamity
befell the island.  Sailors that ply the Sea of Dreams now say that the island
is cursed and those who venture ashore do so to their folly.

As masters of the many schools of magic and magical forces in general,
Spellbinders are able to manipulate such energies at a level that far
exceeds a traditional spellcaster.
 
One such manifestation of this power is that of the Arcane Surge. This
potent spell delivers a powerful boost to a specific school of magic
as selected by the Spellbinder when casting.
 
First, the Mage receives a boost to their level of skill with spells
in the selected school for the duration of the spell.  Second, the
caster's Spelldamage score undergoes a temporary increase.  Finally,
the maximum mana available to the mage increases for the duration of
the spell.
 
These increases are measured based upon the level of skill the caster
has attained with his or her Arcane Surge ability.  In addition, when
Arcane Surge expires, is released, or is dispelled via dispel minor,
the Spellbinder will not only lose the initial benefits of the spell,
but also pay an additional cost of current (not permanent) mana.

this advantage while active.
