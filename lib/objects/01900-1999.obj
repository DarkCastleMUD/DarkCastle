The Akkahad : The Crafting of the Cral    Part I of II
The Dwarven Creation Myth as transcribed by Eleyre
The elves will tell you their legends of the beginning.  Legends which
speak of the gems of power and how they were used to sculpt the world.
And they are right, in the way the elves are always right.  But this is
how the world came to be, before elves found their voices on the skins of
trees and in their curly-scripts.
In the beginning, there was Sadus, and only Sadus.  And in his solitude,
he longed to create.  And from his side he rent a piece of his godflesh,
and in his clenched fist it became as stone.  And from that stone he
fashioned a sphere of stone, called it Cral, and cast it into the
nothing.  It was a barren husk, with enormous caverns and voids within
its folds.  In those folds, Sadus placed things he knew would be precious
to those who would come.  Iron, Adamantium, Mithril, Gold, Silver, Gems
of all size and hue.  And the last he placed was Platinum, the godmetal.
Of all things, Sadus hid this best, for it was this metal that used
wisely could challenge the might of the gods themselves.
Looking down on the world, Sadus found pride in his creation, but found
none with whom he could share it.  So from his heart he drew a portion of
himself, and made Erandus, which in the tongues of old meant 'second.'
And together, he and Erandus crafted Kate, Eleyre, Pirahna, Azrack,
Liriel, and Apshai.  And then those begotten by Sadus and Erandus made
still more divinities, until the heavens were filled with their silver
gleamings.
It was then that Azrack came to Sadus and asked to craft lesser
creatures, and place them within the world, to enjoy the work of the gods
and to craft the raw stuff of Cral into what shapes they desired, paying
homage to Sadus and his begotten.  Sadus was glad of this and gave Azrack
his blessing.  Azrack tore the heart from Cral, and from that sternest of
stone, he made a soul of such power that the gods bade him to sever it
into many.  And Azrack did, portioning it twelve ways, and shaping strong
vessels in which these souls of stone might work the stuff of the world.
These were the first, those who came before.  These were the first of
firsts.  This was the High Clan.  They were as one with the stone as
Eleyre, the Sculpter of Worlds.  In their hands, the godmetal was forged
into ornate spires and temples for the glory of the gods.  And there was
no time when the dwarves and gods lived in such harmony since those days.
But Erandus grew jealous of Azrack's creations.  And from his jealous
heart, he wrought in secret creatures of great power and covetous,
without the will of Sadus.  These he placed into the world in those
caverns the dwarves had not yet found.  And when the dwarves found them,
they named them wurm and dragon.  These fell creatures were the darkest
of things, made as they were from the spite of a god, and in them Erandus
had placed power enough that the children of Azrack were threatened.
And so the High Clan called on Pirahna to aid them, and through the
permission of Sadus, Pirahna instructed the eldest of the High Clan with
the means of crafting the godmetal into forms that would strike the
scaled hides of the spawn of erandus with the force of a thunder.  And
the wurms were driven into the deepest bowels of Cral, where no gems
would glimmer, and the dragons were forced into the gardens of built by
Eleyre and Kate and Liriel beneath the stars.

The Akkahaza : The Crafting of the Cral    Part II of II
The Dwarven Creation Myth as transcribed by Eleyre
It was then that the elves came.  To defend these fragile gardens, the
gods needed people of wood, not of stone.  And so the elves rose from the
tears of Eleyre, Liriel, and Kate.  And they battled the dragons with
what power they had, driving them into the mountains where the elves in
their foolishness thought they would do no harm, driving them back to the
upper reaches of Bara'tivnarak, the First Kingdom.
It was then that the dragons shook the First Kingdom, and made their
lairs amongst its heart, scattering the Clan.  In their exile, new Thains
and Kings were proclaimed to rule in the Emperor's stead.  And thus rose
the early kingdoms of the dwarves: Tivnaruuk, Khromilldor, Ascalbarad,
Khazadturuk, Kher'khirai and Kher'rotuk.
These kingdoms, mighty as they were, had lost great numbers to the
wurmkin and dragons of Erandus, and in their battles with the elves, who
feared their weapons of godmetal and hurled sorcerous thunder into the
mountains to scatter what few dwarves still sought trade with them.
And still Erandus was not satisfied, and from those elves he found black
hearts in, he placed small bits of stone, and created the goblins and
their kin, the orcs.  And in mockery of the stout but humble form from
which Azrack crafted the dwarves, Erandus hewed great cliffs of granite
and sculpted giants.  All of these he cast into and onto Cral, like the
scattering of so many wurm scales in a pitched battle.
It was then that Erandus was cast from Sadus, and the gods made war.  The
earth shook mightily, and the dwarves were driven nearer the surface.  It
was then that the dwarves of Kher'khirai and Tivnaruuk met with the Elves
of Kabeth-Nel in the land of the Daine, and that the history of Elfkind
records our emergence from the heart of Cral, as if new and unknown to its
touch.

Al'haglith - The Creation of the World         Part I of III
The elven creation myth as transcribed by Eleyre.
Before there was Elesthia, before any elves walked this land we now call
home, there was the Void.  For countless ages it had existed, since even
before the creation of time itself.  And within this Void existed he who
is called Sadus.  And the spirit of this being moved within the Void, its
emptiness filling his heart with sorrow and pain.  Consumed by grief,
Sadus tore open his heart and poured out his lifeblood.  Where it fell
arose the first of his offspring.  Kate, Eas, and Erandus are they known
as in the tongues of man.  But amongst the elves they are known as
Mirith, Telrik, and Aelrith.  Born out of Sadus' grief, they were the most
passionate of all the gods.
But eventually Sadus withdrew into himself, leaving this existence to his
offspring.  Mirith and Telrik drew ever closer and through their union bore
other children whom the humans call Azrack, Eleyre, Llevity, and Pirahna.
But in the High Tongue they are called Visrith, Thaere, Elesthir, and
Sirisin.  They too prospered and grew, gaining strength from the bonds
they shared and the bond of their progenitors. And Aelrith saw this and
grew jealous, but hid it away within him so that none of his brethren might
see.
Together, Mirith and Telrik spread their hands and created the land,
called Elesthia.  But it was barren and without life and so Mirith took a
portion of her essence and opened up the land, placing it within a crevice.
And where it touched the land, trees and grass began to blossom.  Telrik,
too, took part in this and spread his hand across the land.  Where the breeze
of his passing touched, fauna emerged to walk the land.  And for a time,
this was good.  But their children looked upon their workings and were
dissatisfied.

So Thaere left her brethren and walked upon the land that her mother and
father had created.  For a countless time she travelled until she at
last came to its edge.  And there she plucked a magnificent gem from the
heart of a volcano and filled it with her energies and emotions.  But such
was the joy within her that the gem could not contain that which she
had placed within it.  And thus the Daine, first among elvenkind, were
born from the energies of the gem known as the Tir.  Thaere looked upon
those that were her children and found delight in their creation.  And so
she placed them as guardians of the land, entrusting the Tir to their
protection.  But all this Aelrith observed and his heart grew ever harder.
Visrith took to Elesthia as well, but he was content to dig deep within
the land.  And from the clay he found there he molded the dwarfkin.  But
Visrith believed more in practicality than in beauty and this he passed on
to his children.  Born of his spirit, they lack the beauty and
creativity of elvenkind but mastered the tools necessary to shape the
land.  And Aelrith saw this and his heart grew ever harder.
Elesthir looked on the children of Visrith and Thaere and smiled.  He too
took to the lands and from the barren earth he fashioned humanity.  But
they lacked the vision of the elves and the practicality of the dwarves.
So that his children would not be endangered, he enhanced their
reproductive abilities so that they might populate the land a hundred
times over.  And Aelrith saw this and his heart grew ever harder.
But Sirisin's delight was humor and jest and so he molded creatures to
resemble the children of his brothers and sister.  But to them he bestowed
the gift of eternal mirth and curiosity.  Such were born the halflings and
gnomes and faeries.  And Aelrith saw all this and his black heart could
take no more.
Silently and swiftly he kidnapped several of these newborn races and took
them back to his lair.  There he worked his foul magicks on them,
corrupting and transforming them into hideous mockeries of what they once
were.  From the humans were born the goblins and the kobolds, from the
elves the orcs, and from dwarves he created the trolls.  Filling them with
a hatred for all living things, he sent them into Elesthia.
Like a black shadow they swarmed across the land, leaving behind them
barren and broken land.  The children Of Thaere and Visrith and Elesthir
were ignorant of such things and welcomed these creatures with open arms,
only to discover too late the darkness in these creatures' hearts.
Enraged by the slaughter of her children, Thaere travelled to Aelrith's
lair to confront him.  But the Firstborn of Sadus knew of her comings and
had already spawned his own kin.  Vile and rank beasts, with hides of
scales and breath of flame, these wyrms quickly overcame the goddess for
they were great in number and she still weak from her journeys.  In
triumph, the wyrms brought her broken body back to their master and father
and laid her out before him.
The news travelled swiftly and it was not long before it came to the ears
of Mirith and Telrik.  A white hot rage swept through Telrik and in his
anger he caused the deaths of a million stars, their lifeglow fading into
nothingness.  Mirith merely wept, her tears filling the valleys and cracks
of the land to form the fickle seas.  Together they summoned their
offspring and made council, knowing that if they did not act quickly that
their creation would be destroyed.

Tyr'haglithos - The Creation of the World      Part III of III
The elven creation myth as transcribed by Eleyre.
It is said that the Final Battle was not long lasting.  Visrith summoned a
host of dwarfkin to burrow beneath Aelrith's lair.  But there they met the
wyrms, those vilest of godkin.  Many dwarves perished and those that
survived were seared so badly that the slightest light singed their eyes.
Thus they were cursed to remain eternally within the darkness of the land.
Telrik and Mirith approached the gates of Aelrith's lair, grieving at the
stench of death and decay that surrounded it.  And when they arrived they
discovered the figure of Thaere impaled upon the gate's spikes.  Through
their combined might they forced open the gates and gently lifed their
child from her prison, laying her body beside the walls.  That done, they
turned the blunt of their anger against their brother.  Horde after horde
of wyrmkin threw themselves at the Children of Sadus, yet none could
stand long beneath their onslaught.  It was not long before Aelrith lay
subdued, his children scattered into the depths of the underground.
Aelrith was taken back to the dwellingplace of Telrik and Mirith, known in
the High Tongue as Kabeth-Myr, and there he was executed.  His body was
cast into the void, to drift for eternity.  Saddened by the loss of their
child, Telrik and Mirith one again joined to produce two more offspring,
known by man as Liriel and Apshai.  But in the High Tongue they are called
Tyani and Misignor.  Quickly they established themselves in Elesthia,
fortifying the broken and cracked places of the land so that the minions
of Aelrith could never return.
But Thaere was brought to the land of her children, known in the High
Tongue as Kabeth-Nel.  And there she was entombed beneath a young sapling.
And from her flesh the sapling grew strength and power.  And the Daine
called it the Ellcrys, meaning "Sacrifice" in the High Tongue.
Thus ended the Time of Beginnings.  The firstborn of the gods prospered,
growing in power if not in number.  And as they wandered the realms of
Elesthia they brought the gift of knowledge and inspiration to the
sun-fearing children of Visrith and to the barbaric offspring of Elesthir.
And the Ellcrys stood within the center of Kabeth-Nel, an eternal symbol
of the light of compassion.
