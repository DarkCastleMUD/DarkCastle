belt~
   Gaiot, once a great general in the armies of Elisidor,
stumbled across this rather ordinary looking leather
belt during his conquests.  Much is not known about
its origin, although its effect upon Gaiot has been
undeniable.  The power that this belt holds corrupts
absolutely, yet it grants immense power.  Even those
close to the so-called-master of this belt are not
spared from its darkness.  Perhaps the generic, bland
design of this belt is the perfect disguise for its
evil purpose.

rage~
   Few mortal men possess the strength of Berkthgar, both mentally to
endure pain and physically to demand subservience.  In a frenzy, it is
believed that a barbarian can lose all judgment and will fight by whatever
means possible.  Few barbarians would go as far as to fight without a
weapon though, save Berkthgar in dire need.  These gauntlets were forged
for just such a situation,  although cumbersome they provide excellent
protection for the hands.  They  have been forged out of iron, but contain a
metallic impurity which gives them a deep red hue, almost like a fine ruby stone.

Few barbarians would go as far as to fight without a weapon, save Berkthgar
who is known to terrify enemies with his gaze alone.  It is said that when
Berkthgar takes the field wearing this mask, his rage is so great that he is
able to recover from damage that would kill most mortal men.  Rumors
persist that this war mask somehow boosts a barbarian's ability to recover
health during combat, but then again, those are just rumors...

   The bloodied skins of dead souls and demons were painfully removed
from their former owners to make these fine boots fit for the King of the
Underworld. Already weathered from years of torture and torment, deep
scars in the tissue have made these quite durable.  Two laces have been
fashioned out of the pearly white tendons of the dead that stitch up from
the toes of the boots all the way up to the shins.  Somehow hair still grows
out of several places in the boots.

curse~
   For years, Lu Bey has hidden in secrecy behind this mask of deception.
Even acquaintances that used to know the real identity of this master
assassin would no longer recognize what has become of him.  This mask
is rather remarkable in that it is impossible to focus clearly on.  When worn,
the mask has a strange ability to mimic the face of anyone that its owner
 desires. Although the deception isn't complete and perfect, many a foe
has been deceived by such magic.  The wearer of this mask pays a small
price as their soul is slowly drained to feed the mask, yet such power
always has its sacrifices.

cape shadows shadow vystir~
This flowing black cape has given its service to the legendary thief
Vystir.  It is rumored to be the same cloak that he wore when he brutally
executed his former masters that disrespected him as a young boy, although
only a few brave souls have ever had the courage to quest him about such
matters.  Several small holes have been warn in the sleeves and armpits
while rough scratches cover the main body of the cloak.  Originally it was
probably quite black and shiny, though the years have made it look much
more like a dirty blanket covered in dirt and dust.  This would make an
excellent disguise for hiding amongst the poor beggars on the street corner.
As you gaze upon the cloak, you hear an insidious whisper in your mind
repeating the word "umbra" over and over...  Curious.

   A perfectly smooth and round crystal orb shimmers a bright blue like the
suns glare off of the ocean as it hovers slightly in the air.  Bright orange
and red flames leap off of the sides of the orb and burn up high up into
the air, although they seem to produce no heat.  The air reverberates
and pulses with the energy given off by this powerful crystal, commanding
the respect of all that are near it.

darkest corners of Sorpigal, it has the uncanny ability to turn the

any visible solid material, there is definitely a noticeable weight to
the ring.

   Drawan has discovered a way to place a small portion of his mighty
power inside objects to draw upon in times of dire need.  This is one
of two earrings that have successfully been made for this purpose.
Drawing upon this talisman creates an unmatched power, able to
overcome even the most savage of wounds. Indecipherable symbols
cover the flower shaped talisman's entire body, while a small moonstone
crystal has been inlayed in the center.  It is hard to tell what kind of
material the talisman is made from, although it is looks like it was carved
from a reddish colored wood.

are visible on the leaves, and a glow from within pulsates faintly.

sword legends legend ghaerad~
Empty desc.
A solo traveler will never find themselves in want of additional company
while in possession of this mighty sword.  Although legendary in its power, its
bark might be far worse than its bite.  An ornately decorated golden hilt gives
way to a rather oversized blade that gleams in the light.  It appears to be in
perfect condition even though the battles that it has fought in are truly
breathtaking. Swift is its strike when wielded by a master swordsman, and
sharp is the tongue lashing received for its misuse.
A note from the manufacturer printed upon the hilt reads:
We hope you enjoy your Ghaerad Sword of Legends(tm) and its
endless witty barbs, however should you tire of the weapon's razor
sharp wit, simply type 'gag sword' while wielding it to enjoy peace
and quiet for a time."
-Sincerely
