[ 1. Directional Movement- $7$BNorth, East, South, West, Up, Down$R            ]
[    These commands are used to move from one room to another.           ]
[                                                                        ]

[    These commands are used for a variety of reasons.  Doors may be     ]
[    both opened and closed, locked and unlocked.  Often you will run    ]
[    across objects that need to be '$7$Bclimbed$R', '$7$Bentered$R', '$7$Bpushed$R' or    ]
[    '$7$Bpulled$R'.  In order to wear pieces of equipment, you can '$7$Bget$R' the  ]
[    item, '$7$Bwear$R' it, '$7$Bwield$R' it, or '$7$Bhold$R' it.  The '$7$Bremove$R' command    ]
[    will remove the object from a worn position on your body to your    ]
[    inventory.                                                          ]

[ 3. Personal Position- $7$BWake, Sleep, Rest, Sit$R                           ]
[    Your personal position has a bearing on how much you hitpoints,     ]
[    mana, and movement you regenerate per tick.  While you will         ]
[    regenerate standing, you will regain more by resting or sleeping.   ]
[    Be careful where you sleep though, as thieves can steal from you    ]
[    while you are deep in slumber.                                      ]

[ To maneuver your way through the realms of Dark Castle, one should     ]

[                                                                        ]
[ 1. Combat Information- $7$BConsider, Scan$R                                  ]
[    These commands are used to give you information before a poential   ]
[    battle.  Typing '$7$Bscan$R' will show you all of the mobiles and PCs     ]
[    that inhabit the rooms around you.  The '$7$Bconsider$R' command gives    ]
[    some basic information about the mobile or PC that you are up       ]
[    against.  On a side note, the higher that both of these commands    ]
[    are practiced, the more information it will give you.  In the case  ]
[    of scan, you will more accurately see whats around you.  In the     ]
[    case of consider, you will be able to glean more information about  ]
[    the mobile or PC you are facing.                                    ]
[                                                                        ]
[ 2. Combat Initiation- $7$BKill, Hit, Murder$R                                ]
[    These commands are used to initiate combat against mobiles and      ]
[    PCs.  For example, you can type '$7$Bkill slime$R' to begin battle        ]
[    against a slime monster.  The '$7$Bkill$R' command can be used against    ]
[    PCs as well, but to make sure you only hit a PC, you can use the    ]
[    '$7$Bmurder$R' command.  Also, you may initiate combat with any combat    ]
[    skills or spells you have.  A mage may begin combat by typing       ]
[    '$7$Bcast 'magic missile' slime$R', while a warrior could type '$7$Bkick      ]
[    slime$R'.                                                             ]
[                                                                        ]
[ 3. Ending Combat- $7$BFlee, Recall$R                                         ]
[    These commands are used to escape from combat if things are not     ]
[    going as well as you hoped they would.  The '$7$Bflee$R' command will     ]
[    take you out of combat and move you one room away from the mob.     ]
[    The '$7$Brecall$R' command can be used both in and out of combat, and     ]
[    will transport you to your 'homed' room.  Remember that both of     ]
[    these commands, viz. flee and recall, have a chance of failure.     ]
[    Please read our extensive set of helpfiles to learn about PC vs.    ]
[    PC combat.                                                          ]
[                                                                        ]

This strange object radiants a dark glow, while slowly turning
as it floats in the air. The surface of the globe looks amazingly
deep... as if you could lost within its depths.

  the blessing of a forgotten god unreadable by any alive today.

spike spear spikespear Khromilldor~
Empty desc.
    A wicked drop-point spike sits atop a pole of carefully-brushed
    Khromilldor steel.  The spearhead resembles a teardrop; wide and
    somewhat bulbous near the shaft, tapering to a long thin point.
    While the spear itself has likely seen much combat, the finish
    on the shaft and spike seems completely unscratched or otherwise
    in less-than-perfect condition.

Empty desc.
  The gauntlets themselves are plated over each finger, hinged with
  chain.  The joints are woven very tightly, yet allow excellent
  flexibility.  Under each plate is a series of crossing horizontal
  and vertical bands of metal; periodically it has thin, wide holes
  to allow strips of leather to bind down the plating of the gauntlet.

spiked field plate Khromilldor~

  Cruel black spikes rise from the polished plates, each designed
  carefully to catch blows and direct them to the sturdiest part of
  an armor segment.  Somehow the smiths of the Khromilldor have
  managed to give the armor a graphite-grey finish not unlike that
  of polished hematite.

Flesh Reaver Fleshreaver spike blade spikeblade Khromilldor~
Empty desc.
    While about the size of a shortsword, this weapon seems specially-
    designed to slip between armor segments.  The blade itself is
    primarily conical, with slight imperfections along the way to
    allow attacks to slip a bit if deflected by weapons or armor.
    The hilt of the blade sports the crossed warhammer and battleaxe
    of the Khromilldor Empire.

Uuruuk lightcleaver bastard sword~
    Forged in the depths of Hell itself, the broad black blade of this
    bastard sword seems to absorb any light around it, radiating a deep
    resonance of toxic evil.  The blade of the sword sweeps in an
    inverted curve along each edge, sliding back outward near the tip
    and crowning in a cruel diamond shape.  The hilt seems crafted of
    polished bone, though no shine graces it.  In fact, the normal
    ivory hue of skeletal remains is unnaturally replaced with a flat
    black, the handle wrapped in the hide of some abombination.

Tharkes Reaver flame red flame-red beard~
    A beard of brilliant red, streaked with wizened grey wisps has been
    torn from the face of some likely-slaughtered dwarf.  Woven in the
    long beard are intricately-etched metal beads, each bearing runes of
    some significance; perhaps a self-indulgant reminder of glory,
    possibly even some actual magical enhancement.

    Forged from fine dwarfsilver, these vambraces have somehow been hued
    to various shades of black.  They don't seem to reflect any light,
    regardless of the brightness.  The joints are well-oiled and cunningly
    crafted such that they don't make the slightest noise when worn.

    An impressive wingspan indeed--though it must not be much of a
    point of pride for the unfortunate demon who lost them.  The
    wings still seem to radiate demonic magicks and occasionally
    flutter to life on their own.  Perhaps they could be used to
    grant some form of limited flight,

    A hard-forged blade slides effortlessly out from a deep black

    damage than driving it in.  The matted black handle absorbs light,
    though even that cannot hide the proud crest of the Khromilldor
    empire carved below the axeblade.

platinum~
    Platinum has many odd alchemal properties; those sufficiently
    talented and knowledgeable in the Art can suffuse objects crafted
    of the metal with powers otherwise unretainable by more mundane
    metal.  While any harlequin magician can enchant a longsword to
    retain fire, only a true master could forge a blade worthy of the
    name Spellbinder.
    This piece of ore is no longer than a baby's arm and no wider
    than an apple.  While the gleam typically associated with refined
    platinum is not present, the ore still glows with a supernatural
    light.  Potential, it seems, cares little for outward appearance.

pendant aqualock git~
    A glittering chain - radiant as the moon and sea dancing at night -
    clasps together, supporting a turquoise crescent made of some
    unknown stone.  Grooving and wear inside the C suggests perhaps it's
    meant to have another piece inserted.  Perhaps the pendant is only
    ornamental without its heart.

    colours scream across the crinkly concertina, a mutated rainbow
    you'll never find after any kind of storm--except for that thrown

    for anyone not familiar with the esoteric fighting styles of
    the Stonefist clan.

pendant aquacore ~
    The naiad Phoebe gave this, the core of the Aquaheart pendant, to
    the one man she felt would truly appreciate it.  A very profound
    gift indeed, given that few naiads ever come to love another even
    nearly as much as they love the seas.  When this circular
    disc of turquoise stone is snapped into the Aqualock pendant, it
    supposedly grants its wearer the ability to commune with the Sea
    herself.  Perhaps she's kept the pieces seperated so neither her
    nor her Captain can abandon the other over their love of their
    common mistress.
