[ `---' ]   1) Cirrus, the mighty platsmith to the gods themselves    [ `---' ]
[       ]      has a "stormy" countenance to match his home's theme.  [       ]
[       ]                                                             [       ]
[       ]   2) This smith is not your regular hermit, though she      [       ]
[       ]      lives in a hut overlooking the sea.                    [       ]
[       ]      Careful you don't lose your head.                      [       ]
[       ]                                                             [       ]
[       ]   3) Gronk, the troll, has been randomly mishapen by the    [       ]
[       ]      entropic nature of his home realm.  He peddles his     [       ]
[       ]      wares a long ways off in the outpost of Far Reach.     [       ]
[       ]                                                             [       ]
[       ]   4) Manx, the frisky feline, didn't always deal in goods   [       ]
[       ]      as legal as platinum in his homeland's bazaar.         [       ]
[       ]                                                             [       ]
[       ]   5) This platinum seller's beak is sharper than his bite.  [       ]
[       ]      Though you might not say the same for the nearby       [       ]
[       ]      palace guards.                                         [       ]
[       ]                                                             [       ]
[       ]   6) The way to find this "well-chiselled" smith becomes    [       ]
[       ]      very "clear" once you know his variety of castle.      [       ]
[       ]                                                             [       ]
[       ]   7) On the path to the dread kingdom of Tharkes you        [       ]
[       ]      can often find Grim Rockcrusher selling his wares.     [       ]

[       ]                                         Gustav.             [       ]
[       ]                                                             [       ]
