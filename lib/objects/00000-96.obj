plate steel etching secret clue~
a piece of steel plate with secret etching~
An important note has been left here, you better pick it up.~
This list is an attempt to codify the world implementors' policies on
charmable mobiles.  Some mobs might already exist in the world that
violate these guidelines; they should be reported if you discover any,
and do not form a precedent for compounding a prior error or old policy.
.
Mobs with the following affects should not be charmable:  fireshield,
lightningshield, is_huge, reflect, eas, special procedures, is_undead,
racist, friendly.
.
The following mob races should not be used: demon, dragon, ghost, golem,
wraith, undead, yrnali, tree.
.
Keep mob hitpoints and barehand damage reasonable.  A 7000 hp charmie
that beats the living shit through sanctuary isn't what a charmie is
supposed to be.  At best, charmies have about the same hit points as an
unmeta'd gameloaded barbarian character of comparable level.  High level
charmies with astronomically low armor class shouldn't be used, either.
.
Probably the best way to figure out what's 'too much' is to ask around about
charmies for the level you are creating the charmie at, do some stats on
those mobiles, and use them as a guideline.  You might go a little higher
or come down a little lower, dependent on your judgment.  Again, if
you're going a little far afield, consult with a world implementor or
more experienced builder for guidance.
