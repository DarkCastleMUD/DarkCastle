Hear ye the tale of darkest night and shadowed souls,
Of cutting blades, sundered light, and burning coals.
The sword of power torn and rendered.
Its aspects scattered, no mercy tendered.
This blade of ancients both shattered and split,
Its cutting edge sought by Darkest Smith.
Its crimson eye of treasure and power,
Held by wizard in a deadly tower.
Last be the hilt flown to a King,
Doth bring to bear a song on wings.
Once should the parts be gathered and made,
Then bring ye forth the Shadowblade!
