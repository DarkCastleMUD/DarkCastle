Tim, the Wizard~
Tim, the Wizard walks around behind the counter, strangely talking to himself.
~
 At first glance, Tim looks like a friendly old fellow with a gentle smile.
His weathered skin and gnarled hands tell the story of glory days now past.
Many of the youngsters in Sorpigal know little about his life as he keeps
as tight-lipped as the sealed potions he sells.  But those who have been
around have a deep respect for the old man and for the many battles he long
ago fought for Sorpigal.
Occasionally, you catch a look in his face as though hes reminiscing of an
age long past, when he was still a young wizard adventuring across the realms.

The smell of fresh-baked pastries whet your appetite as you see a robust
man kneading a large pile of dough,  Flour particles poof into the air as he
hums a strangely familar theme to himself.  He wears a white apron and has
his sleeves rolled up to his elbows.  Bob smiles at you once he notices you
looking over at him.  He dusts off his hands as he walks over and asks if you
would like to see the "showcase" of his wares or if you'd like to "come on

alianna guildmaster master~
Alianna~
A young lady muses about displaying little evidence of her magical potence.
~
A vibrant firey-haired young woman to all appearances. Her mannerisms are
imbued with passion for her chosen devotion: the study and advancement of
the magical arts. Perhaps this is the primary characteristic of all great
persons, the ability to recurrently approach their subject as if stumbling
upon it anew for the first time. Maybe this is why the foresighted Alianna
chose first to focus on the magicks of juvenescence as a beginning sorceress.
It is only her eyes that betray her true age. Wearied and saddened, they look
upon you with the appreciation of one who remembers and longs for what it was
like to truly expose oneself to the magical arts for the first time, untempered
by the cynicism that comes with shedding one's ignorance.
Alianna's story is perhaps one of the best known. Born in year 9150 of the
old calander to a demanding family of prodigious young talents, she was the
only one of her siblings recognized as having no particular bent. It wasn't
long until she was forsaken by her kin as unworthy of the family name and
thrown to the wilderness to fend for her own. Fortunately, she was picked up
by a tribe of wandering humans with whom she learned to harvest her growing
magical powers and massive intellect. By the age of seventeen Alianna was
approached to lead her tribe through the world which had recently been upset
by the breaking of the Tir. She accepted and thus began her impressive career.
Discoverer of Sadus' gem, founder of the line of enforcers, mother to Nyris,
and conqurer of the Circle of Five, Alianna is perhaps the greatest mage to
ever grace the realms. But the great wars and chaotic magicks that determined
the formation of the world have all but become long lost history, and Alianna
is content to settle here in Sorpigal where she is greatly revered and can
impart her particular wisdom on fledging young students of her art. It will
be a shame when she passes, for she is only human and no magic can ever
ultimately withstand the mortality that curses that particular race.

drawan guildmaster master~
Drawan Corindon~
Drawan Corindon sits here, eyes fixed on a scroll of indecipherable symbols.
~
This aged gnome has survived ten times as many battles as one of the most
emminent adventurers will in their entire lifetime. He stands tall for his
race, approaching four and a half feet, and the spritelyness of his movements,
combined with the passion he exudes in his study, indicate that a powerful
youth-retaining magic might be in effect. For one of such high stature, his
clerical regalia is surprisingly modest. Two imposing talismans--one black
with the face of a demon and one red with the shape of a flower--overlay plain
white robes. Drawan's finger plays out a Sisyphean drama with his spectacles,
continualy pushing them back up his nose after which they inevitablly creep
their way back down to the point of almost falling off.

Janikhel Inzha'Xungia, the master of the guild~
Janikhel Inzha'Xungia, the guildmaster, languishes here in a seat of pillows.
~
Janikhel is a rather corpulet man of Arabian descent. He appears to have
no physical skills of merit, and if it weren't for his illustrious title
most would have no idea how he came to a position of such power. His real
name is actually known to few--the name Janikhel itself might even be
made up. The Prince of Lies is how he is referred to by most. A razor
sharp wit, cunning intuition, and the ability to manipulate others with
his silver-tongued words is what have made him one of the most influential
men in Sorpigal. Janikhel has an intricate network of associates and
informants. Nothing goes down in this city without his first knowing about
it--and likley interfereing in it for his own benefit. His slothful image
is a deception to most, for not only can the guildmaster outsmart some of
the best mages around, but he can also outmaneuvear the quickest rogues
in his guild.

A reassured sorcerer casts fear into the hearts of his onlookers.
~
Manix was the quintessence of what it is to be a pernicious sorcerer.
Completely indifferent to the plight of others, he took wicked satisfaction
in bringing destruction and chaos to the city of Sorpigal. Had he his way,
all its denizens would be marred and naked, their equipment hoarded on
unreachable planes for no other reason than pure spite. Amazingly he has
achieved such acts in the past with the aid of great dragons and savage
canines. Fortunately, that was ages ago and his time has well passed. His
spirit has long ago departed. Now he stands imposingly as the guard to
the mage guild.

Skiv moves around his shack with surreptitious efficiency.
~
The proprietor of this infamous establishment is a man of no small reputation
himself. Known for his cruel, dry wit and impressive slight-of-the-hand
tricks, Skiv demands an unspoken respect and somehow manages to gain it from
those you would least expect to be respectful. He is not a traditonally
acknowledged individual among Sorpigal's higher ups, but he has enough
connections--through his customers here and from other various 'services'
he provides--that he can pull the right strings and cause quite a disturbance
in the city should it be his will. For the most part he wanders around dressed
in beggar's clothes and occasionally converses with customers in suppressed
whispers. Skiv seems to have an especial concern with noting who passes
through a doorway in the back of the shack.

A scantily-clad waitress "bounces" about the club as she serves its patrons.

This "well-developed" young  lady appears  to be very  popular with
the clubs clientele.  As she flits  about the  room  serving drinks

friskier patrons.
Clad in a  diaphonous  black widow  costume,  a pink  g-string, and
looking lustily about for "well-rounded" wiseguys, she doesn't seem
to mind the attention.  The scent of  money and  power pervades the
