   You are floating in a formless void, detached from all sensation of physical
matter, surrounded by swirling glowing light, which fades into the relative
darkness around you without any trace of edges or shadow.
   There is a "No Tipping" notice pinned to the darkness.

A totally empty room~
  The walls are completely bare...no nothing at all in the room.
  You feel very lonely in this totally empty room.  Obviously you should
have thought twice before lipping off to the wrong person.

$BAsgard, Home of the Gods$R~
   The dead have highways.
   They run, unerring lines of ghost trains, of dream carriages, across the
wasteland behind our lives. Their thrum and throb can be heard through the
broken places of the world, through cracks made by cruelty, violence, and
depravity.
   It is at these places where the barrier between their world and ours becomes
breached, worn thin by the passage of innumerable feet.
