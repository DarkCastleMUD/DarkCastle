DC ACADEMY RANGE STARTS HERE (null room)~
   You stand at the gates of the newly constructed Dark Castle University.  It
is an immense brick building four stories high.  Fellow students mill about,
going about their studies.  A flagpole stands erect in the center of this small
courtyard, and a flag adorned with a mean looking fish waves gently.  The bell
rings indicating the start of class.

receptionist's desk is situated off to the left, where a pleasant looking young
man assists new students in finding their classes.

Conflict 101 - The Rules of Engagement~
   As you step through the door you enter a small practice yard.  The grass
here is somewhat barren from constantly being trampled, and there are a number
of different surfaces with which to practice your skills.  The yard is
carefully gated off to prevent those pesky Uln'hyrr from bothering you while
you're practicing.  A large whiteboard is leaning against one of the outer
walls with a lesson on combat scrawled across it.  To read the lesson, type
'$7$Blook board$R.'

General Ed. 101 - Introduction to Information Gathering~
   A small alcove dominates this corner of the main academy.  Centered in the
alcove is a long desk covered with pamphlets, brochures, and forms.  A bulletin
board behind the desk outlines many of the courses and information available to
students.  The information available here appears to outline important
commands that students will require when they graduate from the academy and
face the "real world".  To read the lesson in information gathering, type
'look board.'
