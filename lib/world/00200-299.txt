The DC++ Reception Area~
   A busy reception area greets you as you enter Dark Castle.  Players,
Immortals, and Mobiles all bustle about in a literal frenzy as they head to
their assigned places within the realms.  A slinking Enfan stalks his way
downwards to the Albatross Tavern, which leads out into the world.  Most
players to be forming a line heading north where a large sign declares, "Sign
up for DC Academy here!"

   Welcome to the University of Basic MUDding.  Here you will learn the
valuable information that will help you make the most of your time here.
All instructions in the University are in the form of signs, so please
read every sign you see.
   For those of you who do not wish to continue, just go down (type 'down')
to go back to the Inn.  If you already know how to MUD, you might still
want to continue through the school in order to gain starting equipment.
After completing the University course, you should be level 2 and able to
save.

The Platinum Forge in the Clouds~
   Resting atop on a thick, stone floor and floating amidst the clouds is a
mighty forge.  The steam and smoke from the forge burn acridly in your nostrils
and add to the thick cloudiness already present in the smithy.  Assistants
bustle rapidly but proficiently about the platinumworks forging, smelting, and
shaping the raw chunks of rare and precious metals into the rudimentary shapes
of adventuring gear.  Behind the forge itself, adding detail and performing the
finishing touches on many magically imbued items, is Cirrus the platsmith.  It
is said that his talents, while notoriously pricey, have been sought by even
the gods themselves.

check each one, as they will all have information useful to your game

An extremely large and hot smithy~
   The walls of this clay hut are cracked and flaking due to the constant heat
from the forge that sits in the center.  A small hole in the ceiling allows
smoke to escape and a small amount of air circulation to flow through the hut.
Even so, the air is stifling and hot as the forge heats precious metals for
forging.  The implements of a master craftsman are placed neatly on shelves and
tables, and several buckets of cooling oils and water have been set carefully
to the left side of the forge.

      Hopefully by the time you read this, you will no longer be naked!
You should have something on your body, legs and feet.  Next, go east
back where you came from, and if you are primarily a skills user, go north.
If you are primarily a spell caster, go south.  If you're not sure what
you are, ask an immortal (we are found by typing who 51) and we will
tell you.  If no immortal is visible, pray for guidance.

An opulent store and smithy~
   It is difficult to tell whether this store is either a forge or a shoppe.
The shelves are covered in neatly stacked and exotic wares from accross the
realms.  At the far end of the richly appointed store lies a strange, smokeless
forge.  While appearing to burn as hotly as any other forge, its unique
technological design prevents the bustling shoppe from filling with any smoke.
Creatures both strange and familiar, as well as a healthy number of Krys'Kath,
peruse the wares contained within.  Manx is never one to turn away a customer.

     After looking to see what is in your bag, get the items out.
Then try wielding your weapons or wielding one weapon and using a
shield, to see whether you want to inflict more damage or have more
interest in defending against damage from others.

The Crystal Forge~
   A forge of pure, indestructible crystal sits atop a dark crystal dais in the
center of the room.  Smoke rises upwards from it as many workers scramble about
to maintain the tremendous amount of goods they are required to output.  The
primary provider of weapons and goods for the better part of the northern
reaches, this armoury serves in capacities both functional and magical.  Great
works of platinum can be seen stored in locked crystal cabinets to the back of
the room.

The Dark Castle Academy ~
   You stand at the gates of the newly constructed Dark Castle Academy.  It is
an immense brick building four stories high.  Fellow students mill about, going
about their studies.  A flagpole stands erect in the center of this small
courtyard, and a flag adorned with a mean looking fish waves gently.  The bell
rings, and it is time to attend class.

   Welcome to Hatchet's Guild Room.  Here you will learn your skills and
spells.  In order to practice them, you need available practices.  To find
out what spells and skills you can practice and the available practices, type
'practice'.  Then, to practice the specific skill, type practice <skill>,
where skill is the skill or spell you wish to practice.  Practicing increases
the amount you know of that spell or skill, up to a certain maximum.  When
you have practiced all you wish to practice, go west and north to continue.
