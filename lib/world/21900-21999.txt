The Platinum Towers Hotel and Casino~
   Twin moose statues flank the tinted sliding glass doors that open up to the
town's only casino.  A rather large man, with the seedy look of a used car
salesman about him, eagerly rubs one of the moose heads, ostensibly for luck.
Inside, people stand about waiting to check into the hotel.

The lobby~
   The gaudy flashing lights and throngs of people overwhelm the senses.  Off
in the distance, a loud siren and flashing red lights indicate that someone has
won a major jackpot.  Rows upon rows of different table games can be seen;
straight ahead are the blackjack tables.

The blackjack tables~
   People scurry about the blackjack area, searching for perhaps a lively
table, the bar, or possibly the ATM machine.  A cocktail waitress in a short
skirt rushes by, a tray of drinks on one hand.

The upper lobby~
   The flashing lights and loud sounds of the casino floor recede some on this
level.  The soft sounds of ambient music filter quietly through the upper lobby
and several hotel and casino patrons wander about enjoying their vacations.
To the east the entrance to the Platinum Thermal Spas can be seen.  To the
north a large sign declares the Platinum Towers Hotel is currently under
construction.

The Platinum Spa~
   Graceful palm trees and delicate ferns dominate the decor in the Platinum
Spa.  Several spa attendants move about at a measured pace as they take care of
guests.  Patrons appear to be in a very relaxed state and enjoying both the
scents and sounds within the spa.  To the west is the upper lobby and to the
east the main thermal spa room is visible.

A relaxing thermal spa~
   The Platinum Towers Thermal Spa is legendary throughout the realms.  A thick
and delicately scented steam rises from hot rocks that have been carefully
placed within small pools of water about the room.  Magically formed rock
creates natural pools and eddies in which patrons can relax and recover from a
hard day of work, gambling, or adventuring.  Spa attendants move quietly about
serving the guests while careful not to disturb their rest.  The security here
is very tight and some patrons appear comfortable to the point of having made a
home here.

Rows of slots~
   Rows upon rows of slots of all different types fill up the western wing of
the casino.  Several old ladies sit in one row of slots, glaring at anyone who
might dare to take their spots at these particular slots and win their jackpot,
should any of the old ladies get up.  Moving along, there are plenty more slot
machines to go around, and to the north are the high rollers slots.
