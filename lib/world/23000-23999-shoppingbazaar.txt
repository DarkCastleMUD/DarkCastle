The Platinum Strip~
   A large and varied bazaar of goods unfolds to your east.  The street is full
of people shopping at all hours of the day or night looking for that bargain
they know is out there somewhere.  Vendors hawk their goods shouting at you
from all directions about the quality of their shop.  To the north is the grand
gates of the $BPlatinum Towers Casino and Hotel$R.

Lysergic Lane~
   Wandering to and fro, the crowds of people that stream through this bazaar
provide much tax revenue to the city.  A lack of authorities here is not by
accident since many of the 'goods' here are not items neccesarily endorsed by
the Mayor publically.  As long as the taxes keep coming in however, it is
unlikely that they will be stopped.  A barrier to the east indicates the
shopping district is currently closed while it undergoes restoration and
improvements, no doubt paid for with the handsome taxes it generates.

Pirahna's Shop~
   Dust has formed on the counters of this long unused shop.  Empty hooks and
shelves line the walls.  Small footprints of mice searching for anything edible
criss-cross through the dust.

The Sorpigal Consignment Shop~
   The shelves of this small shop are crammed with various items.  Boxes of
unsold goods line the floor, their unmarked contents awaiting an open space for
display.  A few of the items have accumulated a layer of dust, the owners
having forgotten to check back with the Broker on their status.

Eddie's Extravagant Exchange Emporium~
   There isn't much to this little shop.  The back wall is lined with hooks
holding a number of touristy looking t-shirts with cheesy slogans like "Damn
Spoony Bards!" and "Love Monk Stun!"  A simple glass counter occupies most
of the space.  Inside it are stacks of tokens of multiple shapes, colors, and
sizes.

Albert's Laboratory~
The room is large and well lit.  There are shelves along the east wall and a
table along the west wall.  The shelves have books on them.  The tables have
beakers filled with strange liquids simmering underneath different colored
flames.  There is a small sign on the wall.
