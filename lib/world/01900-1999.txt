The Entrance to the Bard's Academy~
   Two huge granite pillars frame the entrance to the famous Academy of Music.
It is here that bards travel to from all over the realms to learn and study
their craft.  The building itself is quite beautiful.  Over three stories high,
each of the outside facing walls is delicately carved with murals depicting the
escapades of some of the realms more famous bards.  The sound of vocals
harmonizing and instruments being strummed floats gently out of the open
windows.

The Bard's Academy~
   The sound of music echoes off of the ornately decorated walls.  Statues,
both large and small, seem to be crammed into every corner, while paintings
cover the walls from the floor to the ceiling, giving this rooms design an
almost garish feeling.  One painting that immediately stands out from all of
the rest is a six foot tall painting on the north wall that depicts the
ever-smiling and ever-vain likeness of Lance the Headmaster.  Nestled in
between a number of statues, a fountain bubbles quietly with crystal clear
water.  An ornate stairway leads up.

   Paintings cover every square inch of the walls in this hallway, and statues
and busts cover whatever open space is left.  The sound of music echoes through
the hallway, originating from the classroom that lies to the west.  To the
north you can find a study room, as well as the headmaster's office.  The sound
of a saw can be heard coming from above you.

The Study~

sheltered from the constant sound of music that fills the rest of the Academy.
It is here that the students can come to relax and study in peace and quiet.
A large bulletin board is resting on the north wall for students and teachers
alike to post notices and information for each other.  In keeping with the
interior design of the rest of the Academy, paintings and statues cover the
walls from floor to ceiling.

Headmaster's office is covered from floor to ceiling in ornate paintings and

depicts the founding of the Academy, while another shows the exploits of the

Skiv's Shack~
   This sordid and opprobrious establishment is a favorite among Sorpigal's
reprobate crowd.  It tends to attract the kind of people who would gamble with
your life even if they'd never met you.  A thick haze of nearly asphyxiating
smoke disturbs your view of the other customers, making them into little more
than vaguely formed shadows.  Compared to the other drinking houses in town,
this one appears unusually calm, almost disturbingly so--that is, there is a
lot of drinking, but absent is the accompanying mirth and laughter.  The
atmosphere is cold and callous.  In the back of the room an unremarkable
doorway tries to conceal its existence.

In the back corner of the room, behind the series of stacked crates that
Skiv uses as his bar, is a shadowy doorway. Instead of an actual door it
has a curtain, which is at the moment pulled halfway to the side and
pinned to the door frame with a cheap dagger. Something about the curtain
catches your eye every so often, but you can't immediately place what it
is. Along the door frame is a pattern of sinuous glpyhs and obscure runes:
magic wards, to protect whatever might be in there from the magiks of the
outside world.

Examining the floor almost makes you ill. It is covered with a sticky

you notice the outline to what would otherwise be an unrecognizable trapdoor

to begin to rot.

Certain areas of the curtain appear to shimmer when struck at a certain

ordinary light does not have any affect, but only magically created light
such as the kind that forms the dull glow around many adventurers' equipment.
Cleverly you position yourself at just the right angle to this curtain
so that the luminescence from a large obsidian earring worn by a surly
elf will be reflected off the curtain straight to you. You are rewarded
as you behold a glistening pattern of wavy bladed dirks--the symbol of
Sorpigal's thieves guild.

A tunnel below the north wall of Sorpigal~
   You find yourself in a cleverly disguised and dingy tunnel that appears to
lead under the north wall of the city of Sorpigal.  This must be the secret
passage that Sorpigal's "less desireable" elements utilize to travel unnoticed
past the prying eyes of the law.  Occasionally footsteps can be heard from
above.

The back room of Skiv's Shack~
   This space appears to connect the shack with an adjacent building--one that
has been hidden away among the high rises common to this section of town and
whose only entrance is through the room you're in right now.  Barrels filled
with various low-grade ales line the south wall underneath a shelf holding some
of the most disgusting liquors you've ever heard of.  Skiv must have a
penchant, for knives for the north wall holds quite a fine collection of wicked
blades, and in one corner is set up a high quality whetstone.  The sounds of
the front room are curiously muted here, as if a kind of aural boundry has been
crossed.  Something about this room makes it very strange.  Thinking about it
some more, it becomes increasingly clear that Skiv's establishment serves
another entirely different purpose: a front for Sorpigal's thieves guild.

The Great Hall of the Thieves' Guild~
   Concealed from the rest of the world by the weathered and unremarkable
building is this lavishly decorated two story chamber.  A reflective floor of
rare black marble stretches confidently from wall to wall.  Beginning at the
western end of the room, near the exit back to Skiv's shack, and continuing all
the way to a balcony at the opposite end of the room is a great gilded double
staircase.  Fine tapestries serving as backgrounds for rows of delicately caved
statues cover the north and south walls.  The spoils from years of illicit
activity have made the treasures of this room rival the palaces of Sorpigal in
riches and decor.

tapestry tapestries wall walls~
The collection of tapestries are just another of the disturbing amenities
that lavish this hall. They illustrate brutal massacares and insidious
treacharies to the point that the most hardened guild member is liable
to scream indecency. Innocent creatures are tortured with methods so subtle
and exacting that crafting their expressions of suffering has become a
fine art to be relished in by the wicked members of this guild.
~
E
statues~
Three sets of grandiose and extravagant statues flank you from both the
north and south wall of this room. Their placement in front of the magnificent
tapestries create the illusion that you stand not in the thieves' guild
of Sorpigal but instead on some otherworldly plane looking directly at
the most awe-demanding beings imaginable to your race's puny mental capacity.
On the south wall, between the two easternmost statues, and partially
concealed by the fine tapestry is a stairway that descends down into darkness.
~
E
statue 1.statue~
Cast from solid gold and weighing more than the gross weight of a dozen
average-sized draconians, this statue resembles an enraged orcish rogue
mistress. Her veins rise out of her tightened skin to the size of strong
cords and indicate the inordinate ammount of unnatrual hormones in her
already too masculine body. The statue glistens in a stongly hypnotic
manner, making you wonder about its magical properties.
~
E
2.statue statue~
A precious acumulation of midnight onyx has been carved into the appearance
of a feral scoundral. A primordial predecessor to today's sophisticated
rogues, he has triumphed over his contemporary brutes and beasts. In his
hands and hanging from a scruffed waistcloth are various crude but efficient
weapons. The mere thought of his day-to-day life shatters any notion one
might have had of a noble savage. His type were quickly rewarded for devising
a mode of survival that preyed on the injured and indigent.
~
E
3.statue~
This statute is made of diamond-inlaid white marble. It depicts a strongly
built man from the long-forgotten Enfanian civilization. He has a dagger
in each hand and is poised to bury them into some unsuspecting reptilian skin.
~
E
4.statue~
Meticulously trimmed coral rests upon the fourth pedestal. It blends together
patches of amber, lavender, and green into an amorphous resemblance of
the demon Thola'reshk. The only component of his honorarium standing before
you that is not torturously vague are the two completely empty and distinctly
formed eye sockets, that strike you as orbs emptiness rather than space
to be filled by the demon's piercing organs.
~
E
5.statue~
A statue of black marble, larger than the rest, appears to jut out of
the equally composed floor. It depicts a sinister drow smirking in pleasure
as he holds an irregurarly-toothed blade that, thanks to some impressive
magic, actually drips real blood. It collects in a pool at the dark elf's
feet next to the ravaged bodies of three corpulent men of apparent power;
one grasps in his dead hands a pair of dice, and on his belt is a pouch
loaded with valuable coins; another wears the insignia of the clergy,
symbolizing the ability to appeal to the gods; and the final slain man
bears a cloak embroidered with the name Zugg. The artist's message for
this scene is clear: that whatever other aides may be available, there
is no substitute for pure skill.
~
E
6.statue~
The sixth and last statue is of bronze speckled with invaluable pearls.
Unfortunately it is impossible to determine what this work was meant to
present, for it has been melted into a shapeless stump. Creases of molten
metal create rifts all through its surface and end in tendrals that rap
down the edge of the pedestal. Large patches of discoloration attest to
the high ammount of heat this thing has been put to, but curiously the
pearls have survived completely untouched. It somehow makes sense although
it shouldn't, as if the destruction was a deliberate act by its creator,
a final touch to a priceless masterpiece. Engraved on the top is a strangely
organic hand are the words: Nullum magnum ingenium sine mixtura dementiae fuit.

A pitch-black basement~
   This is the only room in the guild whose decor matches that of the
building's external appearances.  Nothing in the way of material luxuries can
be found in this dire chamber.  Other than two low burning torches on either
wall, no light source exists to illuminate the greater portion of this room.
The walls are constructed of stone, crumbling mortar, and what appears to be
random bone fragments.  Down here you can hear the rush of Sorpigal's abject
sewer system, and even more noticeably smell its fetid stench.  This room must
have been designed to emulate the working conditions of most guild members, for
this serves as the training room of the guild.

intricately fitted coral banister.  Looking over its side, one feels as if they
are on a luxurious vessel crossing a sea of inky blackness.  On opposite sides
of a richly decorated steel door to the east are a cluttered table and a glass
case containing several brightly colored snakes.  The smell of expensive
incenses and exotic herbs wafts around up here.  Above you is a grand dome.

Inside the glass case are three saliently orange snakes: the dreaded
"Two-Step" Thesali vipers. Their method of execution is efficient and
beautiful; a bite from one of these snakes would cause the victim to yell,
take two steps, and fall over dead. Next to the cage rests a set of small
milking vials and a pair of heavy gloves--gloves, the milker will tell
you, which are but a small insurance against the dread imposed by handling
these deadly reptiles. Native to the distant Vhryllian cliffs, they are
extremely rare and near impossible to catch. Their presence here attests
to the seriousness with which the thieves guild takes its poisons.

platinum braziers burns a pungent incense.  Strung along the wall is a thin

(ears still attached) as a modest remembrance to those who have disrespected
their audience with the guildmaster.

   Stepping out of the alley into a shadowy niche has landed you in front of

Anti-Paladin's guild carved into one of the less noticeable bricks.  A single
entrance to your west is ostensibly unguarded.  However, you get the feeling
that you shouldn't dare to go through it without having business inside.  A
chilling breeze drifts from an unlit upper window bringing with it the stench

around Sorpigal," "Corpse Animation, the dark elf approach," and "What
to do when you've reached pure evil." Further along you find the section
on the philosophy of evil. A tanned leather-bound tome questions the
existance of a dark lord, while another purports that you are your own
dark lord and that selfishness should be the supreme virtue. However,
for each of these skeptical books you find ten others to refute their

   The roof is littered with empty ale bottles and the remains of smoked

edges of the building, not much to prevent one from falling...  Or getting
pushed...  Off the side.  Looking south you can make out, across the river, the
myriad statues decorating the public gardens of Sorpigal.  North you can see as

creatures, some of them unrecoginzable.  Red and purple curtains with images

   You are standing in the middle of a short path leading to a large wooden
structure that appears out of place among Sorpigal's urban architecture.  This
building has been constructed entirely of timber from only the most massive of
trees.  Its east side extends all the way to the city wall, while its western
end stops short of the weapons shop to make way for a training ground from
which you can hear a cacophony of coarse grunts and shouts.  A front door at
least ten feet high is nearly filled by a giant uncouth guard.  On either side
of the front door stand poles bearing banners made from the hide of some huge
beast.  These banners display the symbol of the Sorpigal barbarian's guild.

South End of an Enormous Mead Hall~
   This is the largest indoor space in all of Sorpigal.  The height of this
room alone is enough to make you nauseous.  From the walls hang an inordinate
number of stuffed animal heads and fighting implements.  The main feature of
this room is an immense banquet table, which could easily sit a hundred hungry
barbarians.  Judging by the mess left on the table one would think a feast had
just occured, but really the table seems to remain in this state year round.
An elaborately decorated war drum stands in the corner looking as if it could
produce enough sound to shatter the city walls.

   The scent of ale pervades this end of the hall.  Perhaps it comes from that
fountain, where three guild members are currently approaching a brawl trying to
decide who should fill his mug first.  The table continues from the south, a
mammoth unoccupied chair at its head.  An amazing display of various battle
trophies fills the north wall.  Its centerpiece is a monstorous stuffed boar's
head with conspicuously long tusks.  The only other exit to the building is a
door on the west that leads to the courtyard.

padded hammers.  They are also getting harangued by a very loud and very very
big master sitting in the garden.  Trainees in the rest of the courtyard seem
similarly animated.  There is an enticing punching bag and three thick poles
planted in the ground for one to plant an axe in.  Next to the weapon shop on

about to turn around and go back when a small squirrel nips on your ankle and
shows you a tiny space between the foliage to the south that you might be able
to fit through.

A Secluded Clearing in the Forest~
   This glen is entirely undetectable from the path to the north.  You would
think this was a nice place to rest if it weren't for the feeling that there
are eyes upon you.  Nevertheless your experience here is plesent.  Sunlight,
dimmed just the right ammount by the overhead canopy, warms your face.  The
woodland creatures around here seem unusally friendly, as if they are used to
interacting with travellers.  A nearby tree has some interesting scratches on
it.  Next to it a trail leads west.

The Ranger Guild~
   The Hoan-Dor forest opens up here to reveal what appears to be a campsite, a
permanent one.  Wooden benches, occupied by a couple of weary guild members,
are arranged around the circle of stones that forms a firepit.  The ground here
must be enchanted, for no matter how hard you step on the leaves below your
feet no sound is produced.  A large cluster of bushes, looking as if they could
be concealing something, stands next to a giant boulder upon which a small
dwarven ranger sits while conversing with an eagle.  A path to the east goes
back to the clearing and the trail to town.

   As you climb into the bushes you nearly fall into a shallow dug up hole.
After you regain you balance and resituate yourself, you realize that this
makes a fine hiding spot.  You can watch everybody outside without being
noticed.  It is quite cool down here as well, and dark.  You feel all sorts of
insects crawling around your legs, plus something wet and slithery makes your

Montolio's Spring.  It consists of a short cliff face from which a glistening
stream of water makes its way to a perfectly reflective pond at the cliff's
base.  Deer, racoons, and other denziens of the forest haunt this spring
frequently, finding it an ideal place to replenish their sublunary thirsts.  A

a quarterstaff to a pair of scimitars, are offered to members for practicing

Entrance Hall to the Guild of Swordsmen~
   It is refreshingly cool in this hall, a stark contrast to the hot, crowded
humidity of the street.  The milieu of this guild is an ambivalent mixture of
two opposing social realities: that of the swordsman--highbrow, refined, and an
entire life devoted to crafting a gallant reputation--and that of the
warrior--lowly, disrespected, and striving for little else than proof that his
physical prowess is greater than any other's.  Thus, from the richly panelled
walls there are displayed images of battle so grotesque and of such bad taste
that the common anti-paladin would be offended.  A broad doorway to the south
leads to the main hall of the guild.  A series of alternating banners hang from
the ceiling.

Main Hall of the Swordsmen's Guild~
   The entrance hall ends here at this octagonal chamber, the centerpoint and
main intersection for all guild traffic.  There is enough frivilous decor in
this room to make it a veritable museum.  Crests of ranking guild members line
the ceiling, while dates and locations of infamous battles pattern the floor.
On each of the four walls that do not contain passageways there are enormous
paintings just above glass cases full of artifacts.  Standing in this room,
you feel as if you are absorbing pride in your chosen calling and you
immediately understand why this is where guild members choose to steel
themselves for the illustrious adventures ahead.

chainmail.  Near the back of the room are the fine platemails and intricate
scale mail suits.  The south wall holds weapons of every concievable type:
battle axes, scimitars, broadswords, and even a few longbows.  Behind the
counter metalsmithing implements are in abundence.  Across a great anvil lies a
delicate little longsword, misshapen and obviously here for repair.  Smoke
bellows from a small forge, forming humorous images across a background of

indoor archery range is set up to fill the entire length of the southern wall,
providing maximum distance.  An awkward looking machine designed to promote
proper jousting form is in use by a stocky, black-bearded dwarf.  Burlap
dummies of various shapes and statures, and with their most vulnerable points
marked by an extra bundle of thick red padding, are supported by thick wood
poles.

enticement to get to know your fellow warriors.  This is where the elder
adventurers, years beyond their prime, enjoy telling stories of their past
accomplishments to the younger guild members.  Through a window to the north
you can see across Sativa street and into the weapons shop.  A moderate
collection of books rests on a bookshelf embedded in the southern wall and an
unused fireplace stands in the center of the east wall.

Secret Chamber Behind the Bookcase~
   The room in which you find yourself is dim and unfinished.  The ground
beneath you is nothing more than dirt and pebbles.  On a table in the middle of
the room a low burning candle illuminates a few large sheets of paper, battle
plans of some sort.  The gleam off of a heavy two-handed axe catches your eye.
It leans against the wall next to a blood stained wooden block, whose only
possible use could be for executions--death by beheading.  From the general
atmosphere here you judge that this must be the gathering place of the more
pernicious members of the guild.  Coming from the other side of the east wall
you can hear raucous shouts and laughter.  A lever protrudes from a discolored
section of the north wall, obviously part of the mechanisim by which you got
here in the first place.

   From six shining braziers arranged in a hexagon burn a pleasant smelling and
indigo-colored incense.  They each rest upon thin poles and at their feet are
circular sigils, the corners to a star of David inscribed in the floor.  On the
walls are painted elaborate frescoes that invite you to learn more about the
history of the clerics.  Being in this room, by some undetectable power, makes
you firm of purpose; a new devotion, and even pride, in your chosen profession
fills you with resolution.  In the corner of the room a spiral staircase goes
up to a second floor, while catchy music reaches you from a doorway to the
west.

The history of Dark Castle clerics is played out before you in a series of
involved frescos that cover every square inch of this room's walls. A few
images are given particular emphasis and detail. One depicts clerics surrounded
by flames being struck down by the gods, as though their presumption had
brought immortal wrath upon them. Another shows clerics battling mighty
demons and angels, filling the skies with the sounds of battle. In a freshly
painted fresco, a fish-headed god dims the white aura surrounding a confused
cleric, only to briefly offer him yet another protective shield just as
powerful as the original.

The Cleric Cabaret~
   Half a dozen high tables and a bar constitute this popular gathering place,
which every cleric is sure to frequent at least once during any trip to
Sorpigal.  Surprisingly, the music which is being played (on an enchanted
forepaino and accompying harp) is that which is popular among the lower masses,
not something one would expect to be enjoyed by the sophisticated order of the
clergy.  Most customers at the moment are by themselves, reading in their
specialized perodicals about which gods are currently in style and which are in
disfavor.  Three young clerical students, stressed and weary from a fortnight
of intense study, occupy a table in the back where they eagerly imbibe whatever
liquor they can get their hands on.  Another spiral staircase, mirroring the
one in the room to the east, leads up to the guildmaster's room.

   Your ascent ends at this immaculate room at the top of the guild.  Every
surface here has the shine of being freshly scrubbed down.  A smell unknown to
the rest of the city, that of utter cleanliness, overwhelms all your other
senses.  There is an unoccupied bed flush against the north wall.  The sickest
patients, their lives obviously retaining great worth, get their treatment
here, directly from the guildmaster.  The ceiling has been imbued with a
marvelous enchantment--during the day it is indistinguishable from any other
ceiling, as opaque as a paladin's trusty shield; but during the night it
becomes translucent when exposed to the lunar light.  On the south wall,
between the stairs and a corner desk, is an artfully-stocked bookcase that
would send almost any passionate scholar into immediate ecstasy.

   From this room the clerics of Sorpigal orchestrate a full-scale war on
sickness and injury, pain and disease--or, for some, on the immutability of
death.  A set of windows in the east wall casts light across the floor and
halfway up the grand altar that takes up the complete western end of the room.
Flanking the altar is a giant triptych displaying the multiple devotions
available to the cleric.  The predominating feature of the north wall is a
laboratory bench where balms and elixirs are concocted from a broad offering of
strange herbs and rare minerals.

The altarpiece is a large unfolded wooden triptych with three panels. The

necromancer creating an army of zombies from a field of fallen warriors.
The center, and largest, of the the panels shows a grey robed cleric in
the throes of battle, providing health and sanctuary to a group of adventuring
comrades. The right panel displays a white robed cleric allied with a paladin
in somehow managing to keep alive a barbarian that is taking all but fatal
damage from the onslaught of a giant demon.

   A quaint little dirt road diverges here from the main forest trail and
weaves its way through the fields for about half a mile until it stops before a
low-roofed wooden building.  Lining the path on either side as you near the
monastary are two ordered trails of multicolored lotus flowers: indigo,
crimson, blue, and occasionaly a rare black one.  A beautiful, harmonic
chanting comes from inside and attracts a few curious woodland creatures to the
edge of the Hoan-dor forest, which lies to the west.  Through a thin cluster of
foilage to the east you can spy archers atop the city walls, their boredom
evident in their sloven composures.

Intersection in the Monastary~
   The main room presents an atmosphere that is both spartan and relaxing.  A
simple low-lying table, upon which rests a sole plant, stands against the back
of the room.  The wall opposite the entrance is completely plain except for
minute swrils of thin organic lines that fluildly trace across its surface.
The floor consists of black tiles with a rough gravely texture that
nevertheless have been immaculately swept of any free-lying debris.  The low
ceiling, which could only painfully admit the occasional giant monk, makes the
space somewhat claustrophobic, but this doesn't bother the members of this
guild, who have somehow managed to transcend such corporeal discomforts.

Meditation Chamber~
   The floor of this room is a good foot and a half higher than the adjacent
room, further cramping your vertical freedom.  Nevertheless, a comforting
dearth of aural sensation makes this a prime place for either relaxation or
intense focus.  Situated sporadically around the cold floor are intricately
weaved mats, a few of which are occupied by aged monks vested with deep
concentrations.  They may have been here a just few minutes or an expansive
stretch of days, so ambiguous are their countenance and manner.  You find
yourself unable to speak or to simply make a noise in this place, for even if
you wanted to, it somehow would be a violation of an eternal order, which
infinitely established, could never be altered by a mortal such as yourself.

An Unexpected Annex~
   The room before you appears to have been lost from an earlier time.
Everything in here must be at least seventy years old.  The differences
between this room and the main building are so subtle that you would either
think it was part of the original structure or at most an ancient addition,
the existence of which was, at the time, never meant to be inconspicious.
Its concealment had to have been a deliberate act by somebody with something
to hide.  They obviously did a good job, for this room hasn't been used in ages.
A thick blanket of dust has settled on everything: a bamboo rack holding a set
of hallowed scrolls, an oak writing table, and even a glass case containing an
odd-looking stringed instrument.  Contrary to expectations, the air here is not
stale thanks to two pairs of windows raised high off the ground and which also
provide the room its only source of illumination.  A sliver of light from one
of the windows strikes the floor at your feet and uncovers a daedal and
ceremonial mosiac.  Perhaps this room once held a religious significance in the
function of the guild.

a set of hooks on the east wall, and a large basket filled to the brim with an
assortment of vegetables and fruits is on the ground by the north door.  A
misty painting of a mountain landscape hangs from the east wall.  There is a
pot of tea brewing on a small stove in the corner and the room is graciously
enlivened by its earthy aroma.  On the south wall, a large bookcase frames a
window that looks out to the front of the guild.

The Monk Practice Hall~
   The hall is quite long, going far enough back to accommodate about eight
different stations on either side.  The roof is triangular shaped and forms a
gable by divering from the walls about six feet off the ground.  Monks of
various skill levels come here to practice their maneuvers.  Strong-nerved
trainers calmly instruct inspiring monks is the ways of good engagement and
stance.  There is much talk about ki focusing, as an experienced monk with
great ki abilities is chastised for being unable to use it in its proper way.
A row of five monks simultaneously go to work on punching bags, starting with a
slow pace and focusing on full technique, then working up to lightning- quick
punches that deafen the ears of any nearby observers.  It is acceptable here to
challenge other guild members to a match.

A somber courtyard~
   The grass here is lush and has been flawlessly trimmed to equal levels
throughout this courtyard.  A waist-high wrought iron fence, much like the kind
that would enclose a small graveyard, seperates this area from Sativa Street.
On the near side of the fence grows a line of shrubbery that appears to be home
to a substantial population of winged insects.  These bees and cicadas live in
a state perpetual pilgrimage to and from a redolent flower bed at the western
border of the courtyard near the base of the towering city wall.  At the north
end of the courtyard, expanding to fill the entire space between the wall and
the Meta Shop, looms an imposing church.  Its facade is weathered and covered
with ivy, but shows traces of its original coat of white paint.  The large
wooden doors are raised off the ground, requiring the ascent of a small set of
steps.  A banner hangs over the entry portal.

The guild narthex~
   Upon entering the guild you notice that a balmy music wafts around its
interior.  The air here is chilly and dry, just the thing to keep a solemn
attitude present here in the guild.  A few paladins pass through here
occasionally to and from other parts of the guild.  Many remove their heavier
pieces of armor and place them on a specially equipment designed rack.
Religious symbolism is ubiquitous in this part of the guild.  Crosses, many
draped in fine cloths, and candles are sporadically placed about.  Banners
depicting important events in the history of the church hang from the ceiling.
On the wall is a quite large painting and below it hangs a sign.

A cluttered apse~
   This end of the church is packed with equipment and oddities for which the
guild has found no other place to store.  The floor suffers from such a lack of
walking space that it is surprising this room is even functional.  Innumerable
longswords, battle axes, maces, and even a few lances are stacked upright in
the southern corner.  Tithe coffers collected from congregations throughout the
city have been looted and piled up in the other corner.  You spot the source of
the music you heard upon entering the guild: a player-less pipe organ almost
invisible among some marble statues of famous ex-paladins.  A magical
enchantment of sorts must keep it going.  A weary guild member could easily
find a secluded spot here amidst the piles of tossed-off armor in which to rest
and listen to the relaxing music.  A taut chord, designed for hanging banners,
attaches to the wall next to the organ and ascends up to a trapdoor in the
ceiling.

Nave of the Paladin Guild~
   This is the central space of the church.  From here you can get a full view
of the guild's architecture.  It is more modest than many smiliar buildings
throughout the realm, but impressive nonetheless.  The ceiling is done in a
ribbed vaulted manner and capped by a dome of about fifteen feet in diameter.
Shields, bearing crests of ranking knights within the guild, line the rim of
the dome.  On the ground, in the exact center of the guild, is a small elevated
platform draped with red silk.  This is where new members are expected to kneel
when initiated.  The wall to the west is nearly filled by a humongous stained
glass window.

The training cloisters~
   A set of sequestered cloisters sits here behind the church, where a moldy,
isolated stench haunts the air.  These cloisters were once restricted to
relgious activity, but recently the guild has allowed their use for training
purposes.  Now, hundreds of enthusiastic young humans and elves regularly submit
themselves to grueling physical torture in hopes of fully indoctrinating
themselves in the ways of the guild.  The moss-covered city wall stands to the
north and at its base rest dozens of discarded shields, all aglimmer from the
radiance above.  Paladins who have achieved senority in the guild brazenly walk
about shouting abusive orders in the name of such vague and unobtainable
concepts as deliverance, rapture, and revelation.  It is enough to give you a
sense of insecurity here.

The Sanctuary~
   Here is the holiest spot in the guild, the place for members to seek direct
communication with their God.  A large altar dominates this space.  Two
ceremonial candles, one blue and one white, are burning in ornate candlesticks
on its surface.  A few modest wreaths hang on the various walls and lay at
certain points on the ground.  To the left of the altar is a basin of holy
water, to the right, a heavy bible sits on a pedestal open to some important
passage.  Kneeling around the altar in fixed concentration are a few guild
members trying to garnish extra favor from their God.

Beneath the Sorpigal Mage Guild~
   You are precariously underneath a large three-story tower that houses as the
Sorpigal Mage Guild.  Just east of the entrance, an unadorned staircase begins
wrapping around the room next to the wall, before disappearing into the tower
at the southwest corner of the ceiling.  Directly beneath the center axis of
the tower, a large ornate medallion is nested into the floor.  Senescent
sorcerers and venerable wizards continuously filter in and out from above in a
quiet and determined manner, completely unconcerned by your presence.  An
archway to the south leads back to Arcanus way, where garrulous passers-by
immediately quiet upon realizing they are in the vicinity of some of Sorpigal's
most powerful magics.  At odd intervals the lighting fluxuates and
discomforting surges of energy pulse through your body.  Mages--and Sorpigal
mages are no exception--are often know for their caprice and unpredicability.
So unless you have business here, it may be wisest to quickly move along.

medallion~
The medallion is about five foot in diameter and is emblazoned with the image
of an idealized disembodied hand firmly holding up high a magical orb. Inside
the orb is the picture of a fledging city basking undeneath a glowing star.
The hand and orb constitute the symbol of Sorpigal's mage guild and desginate
this as its home. The picture inside the orb further establishes the current
guildmaster as great mage Alianna, who discovered the gem that is now known
as the Jewel of Sorpigal.

The Laboratory~
   Nausea rises within your stomach upon entering this room and sensing its wild
and out-of-control magics.  Here, neophile spellcrafters are given free range
to conjure any potentially disasterous incantation they may wish.  Above lab
benches periodically spaced along walls are shelves offering complementary
spell components to any interested guild member.  Jars stocked with disgusting
and unidentifiable eyeballs sit next to canisters of dried herbs and decanters
of putrid-smelling liquids.  In the west side of the room, safely caged in by a
magical barrier, a deplorable golem trashes about in madness.  The portal back
south to the rest of the tower is framed by extremely powerful runes designed
to constrain all undesired magic to this room.

Inside the Mage Guild~
   The first floor of the tower is cool and quiet.  Safely inside the guild,
many mages collapse on the various sofas here, sleeping off their heavy mental
fatigue.  Other guild members share a pot of fresh tea and discuss their
adventures in an unabashedly elitist and egotistical manner.  A couple of imp
familiars take turns throwing fire at eachother's faces and laughing in
guttural snorts and chortles.  Fixed to the south wall underneath a circular
window is a silver plaque.  A door in the north wall leads to the spell
laboratory, and on the west side of the room, a staircase cuts through the
entire floor, going from Arcanus way below to the Sorcerer's Lounge above.
There is a mural on the wall to the east.

mural~
The mural details the history of Dark Castle mages. It begins with a series
of images depicting a mage having two of his four followers struck down. It
then segues into the same mage watching in disgust as one of his weapons
melts out of his hands. This is followed by a dimming of the firery aura
which surrounds the the spellcaster. Next, a group of mages look forlorn as
as their final two followers are reduced first to one, then to nothing at all.
They howl in anger as the immortals, begging for forgiveness, offer a
moribund-looking imp. This placates the mages for awhile, but watching as their
old position is usurped by clerics, anti-paladins, and particurarly rangers,
they demand more. Finally they are given the choice of two golems: iron and
stone. It is at this point that the mural has yet to be complete, its edges
fading into the brick wall.

The Library~
   The dimly lit library of the Sorpigal Mage Guild appears impossibly larger
on the inside than its allocation in the tower would allow.  Clearly some magic
is at work.  A row of two- and six-seat tables covers the space just inside the
door.  Bookshelves stocked with innumerable tomes and volumes are just beyond
the tables, and at the opposite end of the room glass cases hold the
collection's most precious documents.  The east wall is covered with wooden
shelves in a honeycomb pattern, the cell of which are filled with tubes
containing scrolls, maps, and parchments.  Despite its tenebrous atmosphere,
this library gets an incredible ammount of use.  All around guild members are
scavenging the stacks, sitting at tables absorbed in ancient tomes, and
transcribing spellbooks--all too preoccupied to take notice of anyone else.
Chancing upon a random book, you notice that it has been meticulously bound by
hand and that its spine is complete with intricate patterns--indicators that
this tome, which is no more than average for this collection, has a value
incomprehensible to the majority of Sorpigal's citizens.

The Sorcerer's Lounge~
   This celebrated outfit is beloved by mages across the realm and doubles as
the hub for all guild activity.  Drinking and socializing in a gratuitously
pretentious manner, the clientele are enough to make one feel vastly inferior
in both wealth and intellect.  An assortment of all the priceless artifacts
currently within this room could probably be used to buy the rest of the city
many times over.  The majority of these guild members are speaking in
undecipherable tongues, while those speaking in languages which you do
recognize seem to be discussing such things as the merits of various familiars,
the best places to aquire spell components, or strategies for battling
different classes of elementals.  From the various vestments worn by the
occupants of this room, a medley of colors and patterns emerge to designate
affiliations and allegiances.  It is a somewhat comforting thought that,
despite their ostensible calm and indifference, every person here seems
frightfully suspicious of their neighbor, as if their careless attitude were no
more than a necessary veneer to survive in this harsh realm.

Top of Mage Guild~
   The top of the mage guild is one of the higest points in the city.  It is
covered by an unsupported roof somehow kept in place by unseen magical forces.
The sides are completely exposed to the open air, and walking up to the edge
gives you a horrible feeling of vertigo.  At this height it is possible to view
over the city walls.  North of the city, vast plains stretch upward toward a
large crimson mountain range.  To the east, a large desert looms in the
distance with two large towers, barely visible, rising out of it.  Southward, a
great expanse of vegetation meets the horizon at the hazy blue line that is the
Sea of Dreams.  Toward the west, you can see nothing but the forest of
Haon-Dor, bifurcated by a narrow trail and speckled by various settlements.  A
few guild members have come up here in attempts to get the greatest effect from
their scrying spells.  Next to the stairway leading down into the tower is an
obsidian pedestal.

Alianna's Chamber~
   Alianna's chamber occupies a small turret extending from the south face of
the main guild tower.  It is a quaint little space, filled with the revered
mage's private possessions.  Alianna's desk sits directly in front of a window
in the south wall.  A person sitting at it would have, in front of them, an
excellent view of Arcanus way; to their right, a series of abstruse paintings
hang above a modest bed; and a heavily stocked bookcase to their left.  Below a
low-hanging chandelier, a circular table sits in the center of the room.  An
owl perch, currently unoccupied, stands next to the desk.

A laden bookcase hand-carved from the richest woods takes up a greater part of
the chamber's east wall. It is stocked mostly of leather bound volumes with
titles in esoteric languages. Their placement is jutted and irregular, hinting
at their constant use. On the bottom shelf a series of books entitled "$4Magical
Dark Ages during The War of Eternal Shadow$R" and written in Alianna's own hand
are lined perfectly flush. They tell of a subject she must no longer need or
wish to revisit. The top shelf of the bookcase has no books, but instead is
full of miniature portrats of Alianna's famous friends and acquaintances:
Intamin, Ellisdel, Shyntoa, and Magnus just to name a few. One portrait has
been turned face down. It is of the traitor Tek'lul.

Pocket of Existence~
   Somehow you've left the world as organized by the directional consciousness
and retreated back into your non-thetic, non-intentional, pre-reflective cogio.
Every conscious existence must exist as both consciousness of existing and
consciousness of a being which is not itself, but you can only wonder why it is
that this particular latter consciousness happens to be the top of the mage
guild.  Regardless, never before have you been so sure of your own existence as
a non-passive being-for-yourself.

   A narrow cobblestone bridge extends over a small river that lies between
Urania's Garden and the island of the Druid's Grove.  The stonework that
constitutes the bridge is both simple and beautiful.  To the north you can see
the Sorpigal's southern district, while to the south lies the famous Druid's
Grove.

The Druid's Grove~
   While quite small in size, the island of the Druid's Grove is lush and
beautiful with its amazing array of flora and fauna.  Ancient greying trees
tower above the island's diverse population of inhabitants, who are themselves
quite mysterious.  Only those who protect and serve nature are allowed within
the grove, and even they must possess great power to study here.  That you are
allowed in the Grove is both an honor and a blessing.  It is here that you will
fully develop your skills and become one of nature's greatest servants.

   Various druids of all levels of experience and expertise roam about,
discussing the merits of certain techniques and spells in defending the great
Mother Nature.  The ground is covered with lush green plats of various kinds.
To the west lies an area of meditation in the middle of a circle of ancient
greying trees.  To the east a waterfall can be heard flowing steadily from the
top of an eastern mountain.  To the south a small and simple hut can be seen.

The Dwelling of the Grand Druid Seamus~
   With only a floor and a ceiling, this small dwelling is the paragon of
simplicity.  There are no man-made objects to be found anywhere.  If the Grand
Druid is thirsty he simply goes to a stream.  If he is hungry he need only to
grab a fruit off a nearby tree.  The only really curious thing about this hut
at all is the single chair that sits in the middle of the room.  At first
glance it looks normal, but upon closer inspection you can see that it is made
of living plants that have grown through the floorboards of the hut.

   A small lake catches the crystal clear water that falls steadily from the
rocky hills above.  While one would think that the sound of crashing water
would be nearly unbearable, here it is rather soothing to the soul.  By looking

should enter the waterfall and find out.

   The moment that you step behind the waterfall and into this cave-like
alcove, all becomes silent.  The chirping of the birds outside cannot be heard,

feet to the east an impenetrable wall of trees hide the source of the water
which flows steadily over the ledge and into the lake below.  There are no
visible paths down to the Grove below.  From this height, however, much of the
realms can be seen.  To your north you see the city of Sorpigal bustling with
activity.  To your east lies the great eastern desert and all of the mysteries
that lie therein.  An immense forest stretches to the west, and the crystal
clear waters of the Sea of Dreams meets the horizon to the south.
