The Albatross Tavern~
   This sea bird is the most popular pub in Sorpigal.  A dim, relaxed
atmosphere pervades this deceptively large room.  There are public
announcements and a bulletin $Bboard$R in the chambers to the west, and low
level characters wait pathetically in the $BChamber of Charity$R, which sits
just below the $Bmorgue$R, to the east.  Some stairs lead upwards, where the
sounds of busy students from the $BDC Academy$R can be heard.

OLD GUILD "Cleric's Inner Sanctum"~
   You stand in a vast chamber, divine energies ebbing and flowing in the
crackling air all around room.  An enormous white altar stands against the west
wall, stretching from the tiled floor to the plaster ceiling.  From its center,
a huge face gazes at you dispassionately, as though judging your worthiness and
finding you slightly lacking.

OLD GUILD "Cleric's Cafe"~
   Clerics from across the land sit at small tables, discussing the intricacies
of animal sacrifice, rites of propriation, the best tailor for ritual robes,
and other highly important and arcane clerical knowledge.  A bored waiter
somehow manages to be at every table as soon as he's needed.  A small sign
hangs on the wall, next to several dartboards showing the pictures of various
gods currently in disfavor.  Another wall holds a set of shelves which bear a
number of tiny statues, many with aromatic incense smouldering in dishes in
front of them.

The Healer's Plaza~
   You find yourself between Indica way to the east and Arcanus lane to the
south, where a rather recently laid cobblestone courtyard opens up before you.
This busy space serves as the center of all medical activities in the city.
Four unconnected sections of a three-foot-tall granite wall form the corners to
an uncompleted ellipse and designate the area in which merchants and healers
are allowed to offer their goods and services to the public.  In the center, a
magnificant old weeping willow, its base surrounded by a tall wrought iron
fence, provides shade to the weary and concealment to the various volunteer
healers that are innundated with requests from a never-ending flow of ill and
injured unfortunates.  To the north stands a two-story wood building that holds
the Sorpigal Cleric's guild.

A barely visible obsidian door stands to the south. A fire in the fireplace
against the western wall leaps with flames of purple, green and gold.  Several

in an ornate wooden rack.  Here and there, small balls of witchlight dart
lazily through the air, apparently abandoned by their users.  Embroidered
cloaks, their folds edged with violet and crimson glows of mystic energy, have
been hung on the coat rack.  The room is badly lit and feels cramped.

A grungy little alley~
   A vile little alley leads between the greystone walls of the architecture of
Sorpigal.  Moisture beads and clings to almost every surface and slime covers
the rounded surfaces of the cobblestones.

carrying tradestuffs to some unknown destination.  Several watercraft have been

surfaces, its long white teeth glimmering as it searches for the little
freshwater crabs that scavenge along the water's edge.

adventurers to the best locations to purchase rare platinum goods.  It is said
that Gustav has received a mandate from the Gods themselves to deliver clues as
to where the mythical "godload" can be acquired.  Gustav is also a master
armourer and as such, is the only person in the realms with the capabilities to
repair the powerful "godload".  A small sign sits atop the countertop providing

The front porch~
The darkened wood has weathered with age and neglect.  To the east is the front
door of this old house.  There are two windows, but thick wooden shutters
obscure them.  The porch smells of old wood and dampness.  There are cobwebs
stretched between the rafters.

The foyer~
The light in the room is dim and comes from a single overhead bulb.  The walls
are made of wood paneling and partly covered in yellowing wallpaper.  The
wooden floor has a dark red stain on it.  There's a layer of dust on
everything.  It looks like no one has cleaned this room in a while.

The Non-Denominational Church of Dark Castle~
   As you enter the cathedral, the first thing that is obvious is the building
is very much a work in progress.  Assorted priests, friars, and acolytes run
about in a frenzy in an effort to prepare the church for its grand opening.
Great arches and intricate buttresses are covered with intricate scaffolding as
construction crews work feverishly.  The one feature that does appear to
immediately draw your attention is a polished marble dais and altar.  Through
all the bustle it exudes an aura of calm and serenity.

The Morgue~
   The room is filled with a thick, decaying scent and a layer of slime covers
the walls and ceiling.  The northern wall is covered by a row of metal
cabinets, each one chill and ominous.  A few of the shelves have been opened in
a hurry, spilling the contents onto the floor in piles.

cabinet cabinets~
On closer examination of the cabinets in this dank hallway you notice a
strange and mystical light flickering through the cracks in one of the
cabinets doors.  Upon getting closer to the cabinet, strange scratchings
of an age long past can barely be seen. They appear to read:
'Mummy Materials of the Old Gods - DANGER!'
Air quickly races past you as it gets violently sucked into the cabinet
through its various cracks. What could this cabinet contain? What indeed?

Chamber of Current Events~
   You are standing in the Chamber of Current Events.  People from around the
world come here to write on the magical stone.  This is a spiritual room, so I
would be cautious when starting trouble.

Chamber of Charity~
   A room where heroes send their spare equipment for the less fortunate.  All
of the heat in this room seems to be escaping through the ceiling.  Looking up
to see what's causing this, a drop of cold blood drips through the ceiling and
into your eye.  You notice fresh drops of blood on most of the equipment
scattered across the floor.  You wonder how there can be such a bloodbath
upstairs without making any sound.
