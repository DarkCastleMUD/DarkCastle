# Dark Castle MUD

[Dark Castle](http://www.dcastle.org/) is a [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) that has been running (almost) continually since the early 90s.  Branched from an early version of [DIKU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DikuMUD) the code has been rewritten multiple times by many authors over the years.  It has been a source of enjoyment and rivalry for many over the years.  In 2020 it was decided to open-source it for the enjoyment of our players that remain, and for some nostalgia for those that return for a visit.

The game is available to login at via telnet at [dcastle.org:23](telnet://dcastle.org) or port 6969 or 8080 for the single-character at a time server, or [dcastle.org:6666](telnet://dcastle.org:6666) for the multiplaying/botting server.
