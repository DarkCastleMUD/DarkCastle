# Dark Castle MUD

[Dark Castle](http://www.dcastle.org/) is a [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) that has been running (almost) continually since the early 90s.  Branched from an early version of [DIKU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DikuMUD) the code has been rewritten multiple times by many authors over the years.  It has been a source of enjoyment and rivalry for many over the years.  In 2020 it was decided to open-source it for the enjoyment of our players and for some nostalgia for those that return for a visit.

The game is available to login via telnet dcastle.org over ports 23, 6969 or 8080 for the standard no-botting/no-multiplaying server or dcastle.org 6666 for the botting/multiplaying server.
